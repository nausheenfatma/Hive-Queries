That said, I have so no such qualms about revealing their absolutely HORRENDOUS customer service practices.\n\nI spoke to a representative yesterday to sign up for internet service at my new apartment.  I specifically asked the representative if there were any promotions currently available, in order to receive the best price possible.  He quoted me 39.99 as their only current promotion for basic internet (not including moden/router rentals, upgraded speed, etc.) Taking him at his word, I accepted, and scheduled an installation.  Thus begins the tale of woe:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n-  Later that night, on the internet:  I see advertised in giant, bold, colorful letters, $24.99 for basic internet.  Just about half the price of the \"promotion\" the representative offered me.\n\n-  I call the representative line to find out what I was told a blatant lie (in nicer terms, of course).  He confirms the promotion is available, but he doesn't have authority to change me to that price. TRANSFER 1, TO SALES!\n\n- Sales also confirms the much cheaper promotion, but says it is an online-only offer, and she absolutely cannot give it to me:  I can only receive it online, and I will need to reschedule my installation.  TRANSFER 2, TO THE INTERNET!\n\n- The internet promotion finds my address alright, but instead of being able to sign up online, every time I reach the promotion page for my address, I receive the same error message:  \"Your session has timed out or encountered an error. Please start over or click the \"Back Button\" on your browser. If you still wish to contact us.\"  This occurs over 3 different computers and the same number of unique browsers.  TRANSFER 3, TO THE ONLINE-CHAT REPRESENTATIVE!\n\n-  Online chat confirms again that the service is available, but I cannot achieve it online, only over the phone.  Having just been told the *exact opposite*, i attempt to point out the circular logic there, but to no avail. Apparently, reducing my price to their own advertised offer would be considered \"downgrading\" a customer, and he is not allowed to do that. TRANSFER 4, TO THE PHONE REPRESENTATIVE (AGAIN)!\n\n-  The new phone representative tells me that as I am NOT a customer, she cannot help me at all.  Still loving the contradictions (the last one claimed that she could not downgrade customers, now I'm not even a customer?  Really?), I try to argue, but she claims sales needs to handle me, and transfers my call.  TRANSFER 5, TO SALES (AGAIN)!\n\n- And at this point, after another few minutes of lovely Charter advertisements and soothingly torturous elevator music, I am transferred to... a voice mail.  This proceeds to Inform me that the Sales Depts. hours are over, so please call back later, and then terminates the call.\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n3 fun filled hours of lies, contradictions, and a misinformation campaign that would dazzle ANY public figure later... absolutely nothing was accomplished, except a gigantic waste of my life and a review that will hopefully reveal these horrifying business practices to all those unsuspecting cable-seeking fellows on Yelp.\n\nBeware.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oLctHIA1AxmsgOuu4dM6Vw"}

Shortly after we first started with Charter our connection went out, took them days to send someone out and it turned out they'd disconnected us for no reason at all. Thanks Charter. Fast forward to the recent past when our bill went up, I called up to try and get a new promotional rate because I'm no paying $60 for internet that bombs out briefly a couple times a day. They said they couldn't do anything better than their listed rate. \nAfter that I decided to downgrade to their lowest speed for the time being in order to save some money. When I called up to do so they transferred me to retentions and magically they offered me a better rate. Turned out they were lying and there was an additional charge on top of that because I wasn't bundling serviced (I have no interest in rotting my brain out watching cable TV or having a phone that I can't take with me in my pocket), when I complained and asked for the original rate the supervisor did not apologize and said the last person I talked to must have assumed I knew about the extra fee. When I told her I wanted the original rate she said there was nothing she could do, what is the point of having a retentions department if the best they can do is what is listed on the website?\nFinally I organized DSL with AT&T which was simple and easy and did not require a visit for installation. I just plugged the DSL modem in and called customer service who guided me through the set up. When I called to cancel with Charter they offered me the original rate but I'm pretty sure it would have been the same thing again. After calling to disconnect I got several calls from Charter trying to get my business back if perhaps they offered me a really good rate but by that point they'd managed to blow whatever shred of credibility they had left in my mind.

There are plenty of other HVAC companies who are more competent and communicative.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZW2WeP2Hp20tq0RG1NFkoQ"}

What I mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews.  I'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the Green Lantern isn't going to be my favorite.  However there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that I've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a Friday night.  The Green Lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely.\n\nMy friend, however, absolutely loves this place.  As such I've had cause to dine here many times over the years.  There are quite a few pluses.  The bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including Ale Asylum offerings.  I love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere.  The service has always been above average and I can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain.  They've got Wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and American cheese.  And finally the Green Lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of McFarland.  I don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping.\n\nThe negatives: first and foremost I've always found the menu to be pretty limited.  I'm not big on fish fry, and the Green Lantern's Friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree.  Now as I said, I'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that I have ordered the fish I've been underwhelmed.  This is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff.  Prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable.  There's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill.  While I've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, I have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card.  That is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses.  Finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a Friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs.  \n\nIf it were just up to me I don't think I'd be going to the Green Lantern all that much.  After all, I don't live in McFarland and I don't really go for supper club fish fries.  But so long as I know people that love going here I'll tag along and have a decent enough time.  I think you'd be hard pressed not to at least be able to do that at the Green Lantern.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA"}

However, the morning after Thanksgiving, it was obviously time to consume more food, so off to the Green Lantern we went.

Many places take advantage of the simplicity by rushing things along.  You end up with edible but uninspired eats.  Though my breakfast arrived shortly after it was ordered, it was cooked properly and with care.  My sunny side up eggs were perfectly done, the whites well set and the yolks warm but properly runny.  The four (!) large slices of bacon were thick and flavorful.  I ordered the hash-browns crispy, and that's how they came.  Everything on the plate was cooked just right and tasted super good.  I could almost like eating breakfast out, if every place served breakfast like this.\n\nService was fast and friendly.  Coffee was the usual diner style, weak and plentiful.  The bar looked capable of producing a solid bloody mary, but alas this went untested.  Prices were as cheap as the day is long.

There are a few places in the mag that I am looking forward to trying but Green Lantern was the first one that we hit up.  \n\nDriving up the place looked kind of small and beat up which was not what I was expecting and not looking forward to.  As we got closer however I realized how big this place was on the inside.  It's huge!   At least it felt huge from where we were sitting.  I'm not sure if it was the article in the magazine that attributed to how crazy busy this place was or if there was a concert or what but this place was insane.  I mean we had to wait for an hour for our table.  On the plus side we had to wait an hour for our table which meant an hour of drinking so I can't really complain.\n\nBecause we had been waiting for so long we also had a chance to look at the menu so when we  finally sat down we knew exactly what we wanted; the waitress loved this.  We started with the calamari which I'm starting to find out is not one of Wisconsin's strong suits.  I don't think I have ever had good calamari here; maybe this will be my next food challenge 'The Great Calamari Showdown'!  Anyway, I had a few pieces of that and let the man have the rest'' he actually really liked it.  \n\nI ordered the salad which was huge, cheesy mashed potato, and 3 pieces of the lightly breaded cod.  The man order the same but with cheesy hash browns.  The fish was pretty good.  It was juicy and fresh and not bad.  I thought it was maybe just a little over the top with the seasoning.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if the flavors were a bit more subtle as opposed to all up in my face the way it was.  With that said however I though it was alright.  The man on the other hand was in love.  He likened his enjoyment of this place to the Tornado Room.  Pure blasphemy.  He clearly doesn't know anything about food. \n\nAll in all I am glad I tried this place but I don't think I will be making it a regular haunt.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA"}

At that point we were offered the \"quick alternative\" of a table downstairs.

Those wear thin, however, when the wait is double what you are initially told and have subsequently relayed to the kids.  Maybe this is all due to an inexperienced host.\n\nOur server was very attentive and the food was good.  We tried the baked, beer-battered, and fried fish.

I had made reservations for us and when we got to the restaurant they informed us it would just be a few more minutes and that we could take a seat at the bar.The bartender was very nice and intuitive, he noticed I was eying up the pickled mushrooms and gave me some for my cocktail.A few minutes later we were promptly seated so the wait was not long at all.We were seated at a nice table by the window with a view of the lake.So far so good.We ordered a kalamari appetizer to share, three beer battered cod fish fry dinners and one breaded shrimp dinner.The kalamari came first and it was ok. Our drinks were finished so we ordered more.Finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals.So we reminded her again.My fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky.My moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing.The cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns I had ordered were good as well.My partners shrimp though was awful.It was greasy and mushy and tasted awful.The French fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted.Our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries.Finally we asked another waitress if she could find her.When we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which I really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was.She did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice.However, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment.Like I said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service.Next time we are going to Tobys nearby instead.They consistently serve quality food along with good service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA"}

I guess I could think of a few things.\n\nI went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?\n\nTo begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \n\nDo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\n\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\n\nSo give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.  And don't you dare forget the tartar sauce.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_wZTYYL7cutanzAnJUTGMA"}

She said that she would have the kitchen make up a new meal, and about 15 minutes later she returned with my same plate, with my original fork and original food.

Oh, did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  \n\nThe bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  We stayed in the Sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  \n\nFor the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  Also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  Then it was baked.  Then it was devoured with great speed.  Seriously, this was heavenly.  Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. \n\nCraig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host.  \n\nMy fiance and I are planning another trip in the spring and we'll be sure to stay with them again.

So happy we chose to stay at The Parsonage for a girls weekend to Madison.\n\nThe highlights:\n- Location: While the B&B is about 25 minutes from downtown Madison, it's very easy to get to. The perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. \n- Price: The three of us chose the top floor Reverend's Retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. It had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. For the Friday & Saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in Madison.\n- Food: Oh my goodness, can Craig cook! The breakfasts alone would've been worth $20/person at a restaurant. Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. \n- The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20s/early 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in Madison. And, Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs. \n\nIf you're in town, definitely look up & consider The Parsonage.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XrzTVrJAjs0yYLvhFI9vkQ"}

Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.

I'm sure the Great Barrier Reef is worth a 5 star review, but I can't give it only 3 stars because its inconvenient (or any review for that matter). \n\nAnyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. \n\nI gave it a shot and I was impressed! \n\nFirst, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. \n\nThe fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. \n\nThe slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. \n\nTarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. \n\nThe bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. \n\nEverything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.\n\nThe service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.\n\nA little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat. \n\nIt's worth it though and I'll be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HxPpZSY6Q1eARuiahhra6A"}

The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.\n\nThen came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.

He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.\n\nApart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.

It only comes in a serving that serves 2-3. Which is a great value because the 3 of us easily got 2 cups each out of it.\n\nThe Fragrant Pork had chestnuts, green peppers, onions, mushrooms and carrots in a garlic tomato sauce, Said that it was spicy hot put I only got a tiny bit of kick.

But I couldn't stop tasting the sauce. It was like no other white sauce I have tasted before. The waitress poured the sauce for the dish right in front of you so it was \"sizzling\". The rice was on the bottom of the skillet plate so it ended up getting crunchy. Adding a great texture to the dish. The shrimp, scallops and chicken in the dish were tender.

This particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur. SO on this stormy night we decided on Chinese and I had recommended we drive to Middleton for what I had heard to be the best around.\nOk..so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot...  ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere.. very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area.\nAfter the immediate seating, WE were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks. which turned out to be just right.\n\nAppetizers were mediocre...nothing to remember...we had the app for two...calamari was HORRIBLE  btw  I could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that....the following is my reason for writing...\n\nMy forewarning is NOT TO TRUST in ordering the Lobster dish. I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.\nMore importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\nWhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!\n\nAs the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return. I cannot tolerate being misled by a server\n We ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned. The storm raged on , I did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you.. Not a total loss I guess.Just stay away from places like this that lie for profit and have followings that end up being ill fated.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q"}

The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\n\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\n\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices.

Waited a full 2 hours for our food. So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste, then read on. . .\n\nFor years I have drove by the Imperial Garden and referred to it as the \"Chinese Restaurant Gas Station\". I don't even know if they are connected or what, but you see them both as you turn the corner. We decided to go to this place for Mother's Day and check it out. Talking to friends over the weekend, we were told it was pretty good.\n\nThe building is nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was way nicer than I expected. Very large and nicely decorated. Not so cheesy like a lot of Chinese-American places in Wisconsin. The hostess greeted us very nicely and having reservations we were seated right away. \n\nNow - we were a larger than average group - table of 8 - but they clearly were set up for groups this big as they had large tables in the corner of the rooms with a spinning lazy susan in the middle that was perfect for us. I think we probably could have even gotten 9 or 10 people on this table. The waitress was very nice too. Came right away and got us drinks and very friendly.\n\nThis is when things went down hill. We did order appetizers, which came out right away. Pot Stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good. Once our whole group arrived we all ordered regular items from their menu. Then we waited. Waited and waited and waited. Apparently so did everyone around us. For hours - over two to be exact. The waitress did her best - kept coming by and telling us she was sorry, that the Kitchen was crazy and that we were next. Honestly we should have left - but it was hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time. \n\nEventually the food came out. To their credit, I thought everything tasted pretty good. I got two different shrimp dishes. Decent flavor, cooked perfectly - the snap peas and water chestnuts were good. Portion was decent on the Shrimp dinner and much larger on the chicken dinners that others in my group got. I agree with other reviews - its not the most adventurous food. Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy at all. My sister-in-law was upset her Sesame Chicken with Broccoli came with one piece of broccoli. She complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli.\n\nOverall, If the food wasn't pretty good - I would have given this place one star. I give our waitress credit for holding it together too. She offered free desert but we were about an hour late for getting to another place so had to go. Saddest thing is we heard that this has been an ongoing problem with the Kitchen. Sounds like they don't fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things. If they could correct this problem and add a bit more flavor into a few dishes, the place really could be ok.\n\nTry it on your own risk - but I would plan on spending several long hours while you wait for your food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q"}

All I do know is that I have gotten my favorites here over and over without ever having any problems.  The staff is always friendly and fast which sets the place apart from several other area restaurants of the genre.  If only for consistency I would rate Mi Cocina a three, and with never having a bad meal I definitely would go with a high 3.5 - 4 stars.\n\nLast time I had the fried tilapia tacos, and I especially enjoyed the spicy cream-based sauce that was served on the side.  It was perfectly seasoned for my taste, though it was a bit hot for my mother.  The tilapia was lightly fried and was still tender.  The accompanying refried beans were decent, and served to allow for the spice from the tacos to dissipate.  I still put the blackened tilapia tacos at Tex Tubbs at the top of my favorites list, but these easily jumped to the #2 position.  On previous trips I've gotten flautas, which were perfectly fried and not too crispy, and the enchiladas sonora, which comes with an excellent spinach and a creamy sauce.  I also really enjoy the cheese and mushroom quesidilla and the fajitas.  My sister, who is lactose-intolerant, had found the menu a bit dairy-laden, but she did end up finding a chicken breast entree that is now her favorite.

Warm, thick chips and a mild salsa are served bountifully. The chips aren't greasy and are not heavily salted which makes me happy.

In my opinion, it tasted like watered down orange soda. And the color is a light peach color. If you want a classic, lime margarita I have yet to find one I love here.

We had just purchased it earlier that year. It was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty. We called Acura Roadside Assistance and they sent out a tow truck that jumped us so that we could drive to the nearest dealer to have the car looked at and fixed. The closest Acura dealer was Zimbrick of Middleton and we dealt with Shane (the manager) in the service department. They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, \"It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it.\". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield. They said they could get us in first thing the next morning to scan it and see why there was a check engine light on. So we spent the night in Brookfield and that dealer took great care of us! They even reserved a rental car in case it was needed. I just wish that's who we would've went to first. Oh, and I forgot to mention earlier...Zimbrick of Middleton put a three inch black scuff on the drivers side rear quarter panel of our white car while it was in the shop. When we noticed it and went in to ask Shane to take a look at it he became extremely short with us and was down right rude. He implied to us that it was there from before and it clearly was not. His level of customer service was appalling.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9brW55Vzyi3ItboHWfoepg"}

The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a \"closer\" room after that.

Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.

Earlier this year, I had a one-bedroom suite for almost three months.  A family member was in the hospital at UW-Madison during this time and this hotel was more than accommodating for the specific needs in our situation.\n\nI'm not going to go into the specific details of the accommodations partly to protect individual privacy.  The other reason not to get so detailed is simply because I think the staff went so far out of their way that these \"favors\" may potentially be abused by other guests if they were aware of the extreme kindness.  \n\nAs I mentioned, this hotel offered many special accommodations.  This allowed us to truly  feel like we had a \"home away from home\".  Most of the staff knew me by name.  They were sensitive to the fact that I had a loved one who was in the hospital and critically ill. I wasn't alone in this, though.  There were many other guests in a similar (if not same) situation as me.  This hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  In addition, I would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  \n\nThe manager, Brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  He and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  The social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. And, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  \n\nThere are several hotel options recommended by UW and we tried three of them.  This one may be five miles away from the main UW hospital, but it is a straight shot along University Avenue.  Now that UW purchased the Best Western Intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to UW patients.  The Intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. The Staybridge-Middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.\n\nUnfortunately, I can not remember all the names of the staff that I would love to thank.  Our housekeeper was perfect.  She cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  For instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of Kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  She always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. \n\nI noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  It's obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  For instance, I first met Bonnie on the shuttle.  She arrived at UW Hospital to pick me up.  She even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  During my stay, I also saw Bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  It turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.\n\nI also feel like I got to know Ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  Between her and Bonnie, I just don't know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  \n\nThere is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, I can't seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  She was so welcoming and learned what I like to eat and drink.  She even encouraged me to take food \"to-go\"  when I needed to rush back to the hospital.  It was like being with family.\n\nJan, Justin and Bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  Not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  \n\nMy final comments are definitely not the least important.  During my stay, I noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  I was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. There may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  However, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  I commend Brad Cook for making diversity a priority.\n\nUntil my next stay...", "type": "review", "business_id": "rKNtd_M2kWDW8sQKYzetKA"}

I really liked the scones, but I didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late.  I didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time I had stopped the place seemed empty.  This was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 AM and I was the first person through the door.  So this weekend, based on Chris & Kelly's recommendations, I stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office.  I found out that all this time I was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood.\n\nI was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside.  The place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.  I walked up and ordered the breakfast special - I was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board.  The price was OK, not under $6 but not more than I would have expected anywhere else.  I was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves.  I'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and I was really impressed by the decor.  I got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - I love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but I tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters.  The coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot.  I savored it while I read a magazine and waited on my breakfast.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out.  The wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but I was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came.  It was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake.  The special, which was basically a Denver scrambler, was completely satisfying, filling but not heavy.  The wheat toast was much better than the average bread you get with breakfast, quite possibly highlight of the food.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole breakfast experience here.  I wasn't planning on finding such a great place for breakfast in the Prairie Cafe.

It's largely a \"self-service\" type place, which is fine by me.  You place your order at the main counter, get your own coffee and condiments, find a table and wait for the food to arrive.  When you're done eating, you clear your own table, take the dishes to the \"dish basket\" and head on your merry way.\n\nThe pancakes aren't anything spectacular - just your regular \"mix made\" pancakes.  They're cooked well, with nice color, and are \"plate size\" so one or two should be plenty for most folks.  They're not obscenely thick; in fact, they're a bit on the thin side, come to think of it.\n\nBreakfast sandwich is decent - an egg, your choice of meat, some cheese, and served on a muffin.\n\nI've also had the Wright Breakfast and today, I had the special, which was two eggs, scrambled with tomatoes, peppers, onion, ham, cheese and a choice of toast.  Again - it was good, but not \"out of this world great.\"\n\nThey're currently serving Alterra-brand coffee; another review references Ancora, but it looks like they've switched to Alterra.  It's good coffee, nonetheless.\n\nStaff keeps largely to themselves, which is nice - no one bothers you throughout the meal.  They don't take credit/debit cards - it's cash or check only.  There's a fair amount of seating indoors and a few metal tables and chairs outside for when the weather is nice.  There tends to be a lot of families that meet here on the weekends, so if kids aren't your thing, steer clear on Saturday and Sunday.

My breakfast this morning (\"special\" plus two pancakes plus coffee) cost $14.10.

My husband and I spent the weekend in Middleton and came here twice because it was so good! \n\nReally enjoyed the ambience, ordering at the register and having our food come out to the table. The fair-trade coffee was outstanding, as were the oatmeal with berries and breakfast sandwich. I was particularly blown away by the chocolate croissant, which I couldn't imagine could trump my favorite at Bennison's in Evanston IL but it was deliciously buttery, flakey and had the best chocolate filling I've ever had in pain chocolat! My husband swore that his mocha was the best he's had in his life. Kind of makes us want to move out here!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. \n\nToday is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their \"new policy\" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, \"That's exactly how we feel.\" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.\n\nI will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors. If the food was exceptional I might try to swallow my pride, but it's really nothing special. There are several other breakfast/coffee shops in the area (including a Starbucks across the road) and I will be patronizing them instead from now on.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

It's a short bike ride from the 53597 and the Alterra Coffee (or is it Colectivo now, I'm so confused) they serve beats the pants off of what you can get from the neighboring Starbucks.  \n\nI wish the outdoors seating area took advantage of the nearby Pheasant Branch Conservancy.  Sipping coffee and watching the locals pick-up their dry-cleaning just isn't the vibe I'm looking for I guess.  \n\nI can't vouch for the breakfast or lunch selections, since I'm just a coffee and baked goods sort of guy.  As for baked goods, I've had some excellent scones and muffins at Prairie.  Like scream it from the rooftop great.  But not every time.  Just when I'm ready to proclaim Prairie my go to coffee and a scone hangout, I get a scone that's as dry as Atacama Desert.  And since I'm dropping some decent coin here, I want better consistency.\n\nThings I like:\n * Love the staff here. Even when the place is getting slammed by waves of morning commuters looking for their sugar and caffeine fix, I always get a smile and courteous service.\n *  Always love me some free wi--fi.  Never had a problem connecting or with download speeds.\n * The noise level indoors always seems to be a soft murmur, with some relaxing music wafting in the background.  Never had a problem carrying on a conversation with my table mates.\n * When the FDA approves Alterra Coffee for intravenous use, I'll be first in line.  There are always are four or five roasts to choose from and I've never had a skunky cup.\n\nThings I don't\n *The \"cash only\" thing was so hip in the 18th century, but it's 2013 now.  Start taking plastic, people.\n * The baked goods are not inexpensive.  It's usually worth it, but it's annoying as hell when I lose the muffin lottery.\n\nIt's a solid three star option with lots of upside if the bakery improves its consistency.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

My first indication that I was not in Peking, was the Hispanic girl struggling to understand my English ordering and the POS system which was also in English.

The fried rice was disgusting, just a greasy mush of dirty looking rice, mushrooms and egg. Finally, the pot stickers, ah the pot stickers, they should have stuck to the pot.

I've never dined in, so I won't comment on atmosphere.\n\nTheir menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line. \n\nFor the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. \n\nHowever, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. \n\nI pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch. \n\nLesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs.\n\n**** I thought eventually I'd go back, but I haven't been since then.

I require a side dish of epinephrine if I eat crab, so I appreciate this omission. Now that I have established that I go here just for the cream cheese puffs, it should be clear that I'm far from an expert on Asian food. So take the rest of my review with a grain of salt; there should be plenty to spare in your entree. \n\nI used to think this place was ok -- it still has plenty of variety, a very friendly staff, good chili-garlic sauce, decent potstickers, above-average lettuce wraps, no grisly or fatty pieces of meat -- but lately the preparation has been sloppy and the presentation just as bad. I suspect the quality of the ingredients has come down a notch. \n\nAfter cream cheese wontons, Pad Thai is one of my favorite Asian entrees. My last order looked like Goldilocks's porridge in the \"Three Little Bears\" Golden Book I had as a kid. Dull gray, soupy, greasy, salty and watery, yet somehow sticky. The chopped peanuts added no crunch at all, which is too bad because other than the chicken pieces I picked through the mess to find, I was hoping to find something else edible. Epic fail on this entree. \n\nOn my next visit, I ordered the Firecracker noodles with chicken, as a side to my beloved wontons. Slight improvement from last time but still salty as the Dead Sea and enough grease to de-squeak every door hinge on the west side. The bag was so heavy I skipped my biceps workout for a week. The red peppers had no life left. Again, I hunted and pecked for the chicken, which is consistently decent-quality, well-prepared white meat. My wife's veggie fried rice would have been ok -- they ease up on the salt and Valvoline for this entree -- but the vegetables were overcooked and charred in places. Fresh veggies should present as a bright spectrum of colors -- orange from the carrots, bright green from the scallions, broccoli and pea pods, yellow from the corncobettes. Instead, however, they were the same brown color as the fried rice. \n\nMy last fortune cookie said I'll probably return to Chin's. It's on the way home from work, the food comes out fast and I can't resist those damn cream cheese wontons. Maybe I'll throw in some potstickers or wraps and call it dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KW6HejC-67KSL9J8Cz1dSw"}

For a while, it was the next great thing - there always were long lines of families anxious to get their butterfat and sugar fix.  The buzz has faded and now those same families flock to the local froyo joints to get their frozen dairy fix.  I stopped by this weekend while shopping at Greenway Station and found the store devoid of patrons.  I know it's been a long, cold winter, but we Wisconsinites love our ice cream and Babcock Hall was standing room only when I visited later that same day.\n\nSo why does my ice-creaming loving family now generally eschew Cold Stone?\n* Texture - I really prefer a firm scoop of ice cream and that's not what you get at Cold Stone.  The texture is far too gooey for my liking.  It's not terrible, but I much prefer the denser texture of the product at Babcock Dairy or The Chocolate Shoppe any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  The other textural problem is that Cold Stone ice cream melts too fast, so bring a gross of handi-wipes when bringing the kiddos here. \n \n* Flavor - The ice cream here is too sweet.  At Cold Stone, it is all about excess, whether it be about the butterfat content, the sugar content or the oversaturated flavorings.  Again, it's not terrible, but it's just not my cup of tea.\n\n* Serving Size - The theme of excess carries over to the over-the-top serving sizes.  While I am not a huge fan of froyo, at least I can control my serving size when I visit the near-by Menchies or Orange Leaf.  In addition, while I'm on the topic of serving sizes, can I just add that I detest the cutesy \"Like It\", \"Love It\" and \"Gotta Have It\" serving size names.\n\n* Service - When the place first opened, the staff was energetic and responsive.  I admit it was hokey, but I kinda liked the dorky songs they sang when you left a tip.  But now, a trip to Cold Stone is more like visiting a gulag.  Leaving a tip rarely triggers a response, much less a chorus of \"Ice cream, baby\" sung to the tune of Ice, Ice Baby.  My other pet peeve is that the tables always seem to be sticky, thanks to the soupiness of the ice cream.  It's really kind of a depressing place to visit now.\n\n* Pro tip: If you have a peanut allergy, have them clean the stone before they mix your ice cream or you risk cross contaminating your treat.  (I learned that the hard way.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "AYoLKzRFajucKnjIFxc__A"}

At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  \n\nFortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.\n\nThere are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  It is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  Some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others.", "type": "review", "business_id": "c5awCF5eu0ZkxUf_i94uPA"}

I wish I could give them ten stars! I've got three corgis and after a co-worker referred me here in 2009, I'll never go anywhere else. Every vet my dogs have seen is wonderful...between the three pups I've met with three of the doctors. They're all sincere, empathetic, thorough, understanding, engaging, respectful, and love to share their knowledge. Dr. Haroldson is a sweetheart and can probably put any nervous pet-parent at ease. Dr. Erickson is calm and laid-back, and I can talk to him about even the most awkward pet problems. Dr. Schweitzer is lively--a total hoot. Anyone who likes The Walking Dead AND Downton Abbey is alright in my book!\n\nAll Pets has been able to see me with very short notice, has never rushed me in and out the door, and always made me feel like my dogs were their top priority, even on busier days. They communicate clearly about diagnostic and treatment options. Their prices are very reasonable, and they try less expensive solutions first, instead of immediately recommending the most costly. Not that I'm cheap, it's just that having three dogs adds up. When they weren't 100% positive about something, they aren't afraid to ask each other for second opinions, which I appreciated when my dog Harry swallowed a corncob and had to have emergency surgery.\n\nThat's another thing I love about this place, is that they remember all my dogs names when I walk in the door. Not only the vets, but the front desk staff. Maybe it's my fiction-writer's imagination, but they really make me feel like a VIP. Kenna is always so excited to greet my pups and I love hearing about hers. Dana has a killer sense of humor and if you're lucky, she'll grace you with one of her zingers. Having three rambunctious corgis that get into trouble (catching rabbits and getting worms, swallowing corncobs and needing surgery, attacking car windows and breaking teeth, spraining toes from too much running) means I get to visit more often, and I honestly do not mind at all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9874O-3GjXPotxYKNNAz5Q"}

Check-in was simple and the employees seemed to enjoy our enthusiasm and joking around. They even welcomed us with fresh cookies. How can you hate on a hotel with cookies?

The nice thing was that we were close enough to the starting line that it wasn't a huge issue for our first group of runners to leave at 5am and get there on time; however, being somewhat closer to where the race started might have been nicer and we're looking into that for 2013, because it was a bit of a haul for the second van (my van).\n\nOn the other hand, we were far enough away that this hotel did not fill up immediately and it had no problem blocking off some rooms for us and we were right off the highway, very close to restaurants for an easy group dinner and there is a shopping center right next door. I took full advantage of stocking up on anything I might have missed by going to the local Erehwon and running shop. That was incredibly convenient. They also have a really good continental breakfast.\n\nAs far as the hotel room: the beds were incredibly comfortable but the shower drain was backed up. I ended up in a couple inches of dirty water, which is never fun. However, I had some of the best sleep of my life.

Thursday nights feature Westside Andy & Mel Ford, and that is always a good time.  There are decent taps, though last time I was there I believe they had removed Esser's Best which was my go-to every time there.  Most of the specials tend toward the $1 shot variety, but I especially like that Capital pints are $2 on Wednesdays and you can get pitchers of Spotted on Fridays for a crazy $5.  I also learned that your second drink before noon on Sundays is free, and domestic taps are 50 cents.  More on that later.  The bartenders are for the most part good, but if you're there on the wrong day they seem to forget about you in favor of talking with the regulars.\n\nThe food is pretty standard: not too fancy but good.  Sometimes the food doesn't come as advertised in the menu.  Once I ordered a Reuben that strangely was lacking Swiss cheese, though I didn't notice until halfway through as it was still a tasty sandwich.  I like the bison burger here, but the last time I ordered this it came sans tomatoes, likely due to the salmonella issue at the time.  Also that day my sister found the Hody Chicken's buffalo sauce to be beyond her tolerance for spiciness.  My sister's boyfriend was suitably impressed with the Hody burger, but he thought that they had left of the special Hody sauce.  It might have just been a bad day, because most of the other times I've been here there were no problems.  I do believe that the overall quality depends on the day you stop in.  Some of the bartenders kind of throw things together, while others take their time and do a decent job.  I haven't been there regularly enough to establish a schedule, so it's been hit or miss for me lately.  I've also tried a few of the appetizers and the onion straws and quesidilla wrappers are very good every time I've had them.  \n\nThe main drawback with the Hody is the regular crowd.  On Thursdays when Westside Andy & Mel Ford are playing the crowd is great - a variety of people, young and old, some dancing to the music, some sitting at the bar or nearby tables.  Other nights the crowd can get a bit too townie for my liking.  It can be uncomfortable, especially when half the bar turns to look at you when you walk in.  Sundays can be the worst.  I think that some of those people nearly live there.  The place is pretty open and there is a lot of space, but it still can get quite smoky.  There is a few outdoor tables along Elmwood, and these are perfect for a weekend afternoon.  I would probably return to the Hody more if it weren't for the small inconsistencies in the food and the slight hostile feeling that I sometimes pick up from the regulars, but overall the Hody is a reliably good time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xbJ9tdGbcVJIUkNgHSCwZQ"}

I also had roasted shrimp for my entree, which were delicious! Nice spicy flavor, with a ton of rosemary. I wasn't too impressed with the side of spinach and tomatoes, however. The Cabernet reduction that they came DOUSED in was a bit too rich. I wish it had been more of a glaze than a heavy sauce. No matter, I was too full to eat much of it anyhow. My boyfriend seemed surprised and delighted by the coffee roasted chicken with the orange-ricotta sauce( the bite I had was quite tasty). \n\nAlso, I love the fact that they have live jazz on the piano tues-sat nights starting at 6pm(although tonight he started more like 6:30).

It's dimly lit, underground, but often times has a pianist setting the New Orleans mood.\n\nThe food is incredible. Every time we go there we try to get something different, and we're floored by how good the meals are, and how much of it you get.

We've had the roasted shrimp, the tasso and shrimp fettucine, the maple-cured duck, the steak, the seafood au gratin, and each time not only did we get one delicious meal, but enough to have an amazing lunch the next day.\n\nThe only con I can give Louisianne's is that they give you so much good food that you can never get to the desserts.

The decor is indeed cozy- like a nicely made-up cellar.  There was plenty of room at the bar so we sat there before our reservation time arrived.  Only two beers on tap, but both good local brews from Capital. \nEventually sat at our table & perused the menu.  Found many appetizers that sounded really good (including one of the specials that night) so we decided on sharing 2 apps and one entree... seemed like a good way to try a few items without getting too much food.\nApp #1 (the special): gnocchi in a savory cream sauce with crawfish was very tasty.  Seemed a bit light in the gnocchi (I think there were 5 or 6) but made up for it in sauce.  Two thumbs way up.\nApp #2: mussels in cream sauce... I had asked about the size of the mussels ahead of time and was told they were medium to large.  They were in fact medium to small, which was a bit of a bummer because we probably would have gone with a different app had we known.  But the flavors were good & we enjoyed sopping up the sauce with the bread.  And the bread they serve is quite good.  Two thumbs up.\nEntree: Crawfish Etouffe... I was excited to try this as I hadn't had etouffe in years.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  If you went to a friend's house for dinner and they served this you'd be psyched, but at an upscale Cajun restaurant for $20 you may be left underwhelmed.  Two thumbs halfway up.  The salad that came with was fresh mesclun greens, with a bleu cheese dressing that was chunky but bland.\nMidway thru our meal the jazz combo started up and sounded really good- definitely added to the atmosphere.  For dessert we shared a slice of key lime pie... nice-tasting but no great shakes.  It seemed to be thickened with gelatin and I suppose I prefer mine to be creamier, plus it was lacking in zing, but only mildly.  Again, if your friend served it you'd rightfully congratulate them but for $6.50 it should be REALLY good.\nOur server was very nice & professional.  Absolutely no complaints there.\nThe nicest surprise came with the bill- only $70... and that included 5 drinks.\nWe have concluded that the next time we go we'll sit in the bar area and have drinks & apps.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest. Everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse. If you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option. Presentation was lacking but I don't think that's the point of soul food.  \n\nService is sassy but whole-hearted. We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told \"yeah, if you can find seats\".  We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. It isn't bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that's better. Maria, our bartender who's worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night. \n\nIt's a great place to bring guests if you want to head off to a chill and unexpected place. Even better if you're prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed comfort food. Try the Sazerac if you want a stiff, sweet drink and the Hurricane if you want a fruity, refreshing beverage that punches like a Long Island.

We had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers.  I didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh.  Rather it was definitely of the frozen variety.  And everything was made with frozen puff pastry.  Even the escargot were covered with puff pastry. I think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  Anyway, the appetizers reminded me of Pinterest recipes.  \n\nA big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish.  That usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit.  I think we experienced a little of both.  \n\nMy husband and I both got the special. It was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes.  Each component sounded good.  However, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck.  \n\nThe tenderloin came on skewers.  What?  The shrimp were over cooked.  The meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms.  Everything was covered in some sort of Cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of Durkee or McCormick.  Then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce.  The whole thing tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck  and reheated. \n\nOne of our companions ordered the filet.  She let us have a taste, and the steak was good.  But it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter.  \n\nDessert was a dark chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It was dry and pedestrian.  \n\nReally I think this place deserves 2.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I'll be generous.  Lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place.  I would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and I could still enjoy them now that I know what to expect.  \n\nBut I would not return for dinner.  If I'm going to spend $30 for an entree, I expect fresh ingredients, sauces made to order, and a chef that knows how to cook.  Madison has too many restaurants that offer far superior food to Lousiannes, and that's what will drive my future dining decisions.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

Having never been to Louisianne's in the 5 years that I've lived in Middleton, I suggested we try it out.\n\nI give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars. Although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but. You walk into Louisianne's and immediately head downstairs. It's all stone and looks like you're walking into a cool cave or something. It's dark, but there's a lot of ambiance. I've been to New Orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it. It's romantic, fun, and not what you'd expect from the outside. I felt like we were on vacation while we were there. Also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking. It was awesome!\n\nWe went at about 8pm on a Friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine. While we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band. I had red wine, and my husband had Jameson on the rocks. \n\nWe were seated and ordered the Pecan Crab Cakes as an appetizer. They were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other Midwestern crab cakes that I've had before. They were heavy on bread and light on crab...with a lot of Old Bay seasoning. Again, they weren't bad at all, but not spectacular.\n\nNext, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute).  We were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup. They had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which I got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had). Both soups were fantastic! Definitely 5 stars for the soup. \n\nI'll take a minute here to comment that I enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart. (It reminds me of dining in Wisconsin supper clubs as a child). By the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! \n\nOnto the entrees! My husband absolutely LOVED his dish. He claims that it was possibly \"the best thing I've ever had in a restaurant\". He chose the Coffee Roasted Chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a \"hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce\". I think there was spinach in it too. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy. It almost reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead. Although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not. It had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness. Delicious. 5 stars.\n\nThe reason that Louisianne's is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which I felt was very underwhelming. We don't eat pasta at home for health reasons, so I usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat. I chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic New Orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham). The shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse. The dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous...probably the best part. However, the pasta was supposed to have a \"Creole mustard cream sauce\", and it didn't really. The sauce was very light, and had little flavor. It was kind of sad, because I was really hoping to be wowed and I wasn't. I'd say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful. \n\nThe service was adequate. Nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way.\n\nSummary: I'd definitely return. I think Lousianne's Etc. is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions. Their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on Yelp, seems to be consistency. Some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh. The major problem with this is that Louisianne's  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally...so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won't return for a second chance. I think this explains why the Yelp reviews for Louisianne's are so polarized.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

I thought initially it was going to be an amazing hotel, since I totally screwed up on the reservation (made it for the wrong day) and the girl at the desk was so cool to work with me and get me a room when the whole place was fully booked.  \n\nExcept, the place was fully booked for the \"Little Miss Junior Miss\" Pageant, or some other stupid name like that, which meant HELL for Andy and I as the entire place was infested with pre-teen beauty queens, their scary domineering mothers, and other random siblings that came along for the ride.  Can you say O. M. G.  \n\nNow, normally this would be a non-issue, as we are rarely in our hotel room except to sleep and once in the room you couldnt hear a lot of hallway noise.  But this 10 story hotel had a grand total of 2 elevators, which were packed at all hours of the day with girls in gowns and tiaras, groups of girls in heavy makeup, or wet children dripping from the hotel pool. This made getting in and out a bit challenging since we were on the top floor. \n\nI realize this is hardly Marriotts fault that the Junior Misses had descended upon Middleton, since they are just trying to turn a buck in this economy, but the design of this place was not user friendly in the slightest.  Also, hey brilliant idea guys, put the pool across the hall from the elevator and then make that whole area tile so people track water out and the floor is slippery!  Nice.  And also understaff the dining area so noone can get in and eat because there is noone to clean off the tables and take your order.  Nice planning!\n\nMan, that whole experience left a bad taste.  The worst part will be trying to convince Andy to stay at a Marriott ever again as he is just now getting relief from the migrane he got on Saturday.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

It's disturbing that Parent's lives are so unfulfilled that they have to dress their children like Cocktail waitresses at a seedy bar. \nThe hotel was totally booked. You had ten floors worth of rooms, but yet the hotel only had two elevators. It was pretty annoying to wait 15 minutes every time you wanted to go up to your room. \nAnd the kicker was on Sunday morning when we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The hotel had nobody on duty to bus tables, so while it was obvious that the restaurant was half empty, but there was a 15 minute wait to be seated. Of course the hostess acted like an office temp, with a bad attitude. That was a perfect ending to our hell stay at the Marriott-Madison West.

It would have been an easy, quick jaunt out the front door with it.\n- The 20min it took to get extra towels\n- The empty ice bin in the vending area\n- The desk clerk who came out to talk to customers while still chewing food\n\nBy far the worst offense was the fact that check-out time was noon, yet housekeeping tried to enter our room at EIGHT IN THE MORNING.

Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints.  Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff.  It greatly lacks attention to detail.  I frequently have to call for things that have been left out of the room (missing hairdryer, washcloths, double body wash but no shampoo...and so on).   The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains).  I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room.

I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out.  All of the power in the room was then knocked out.  This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous.  I was lucky my computer was not fried.  The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu.  I then crumpled the menu and threw it away.  The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow.  I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up.  Outrageous.  Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind.  I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers.

Several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari. That was no fun for anybody. I highly recommend the Sprecher Brewery restaurant across the street - comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food! \n\nThe temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well.

I knew this cause the phone was tan/beige colored.  It was yucky.  Also, the tub liner in the first room was filthy.  Another thing I wish this hotel would change is installing fans in the bathrooms!  My boyfriend also pointed out that the sheets on the bed were super starched.   If you moved it sounded like sandpaper on sandpaper.  Madness.  I did have a odd triangle shaped hole in the sheets on my side of the bed...so that was less than plesant too.

Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.\n\nUnfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  The rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).\n\nThe breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  The food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  Food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  In addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.\n\nThis Marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  The rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  The room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  The shower was fine.\n\nThis Marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member.  The suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  Their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.\n\nOn weekends, Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per Saturday and Sunday or 750 Marriott Rewards points per Saturday and Sunday.  This is a new nationwide Marriott benefit for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  I have been to a few properties (Santa Clara Marriott, Minneapolis Marriott City Center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this Marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).\n\nThe front desk was nice and helpful.\n\nRoom rates are good, but this hotel is not in Downtown Madison.  It is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to Madison though.  However, I am not sure if getting to Downtown Madison on a Wisconsin football game day is challenging.\n\nThis Marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  This hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  It is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.  If you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member, they do treat you well here and maybe even better than some Marriott properties.\n\nThis Marriott has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

There is part of me that wants to go a little lower, but the management on a couple occasions and the general kindness of the concierge lounge attendants made up an extra star. \n\nThis Marriott is about the level of a nicer Courtyard Marriott. The ONLY way our stay was bearable was because we were upgraded to suite. If we had not had the door to separate our bedroom from living space, we would have been unable to rest with all of the noise coming up from the atrium..and we were on the 9th floor. A cocktail reception on a Tuesday night in the vast open space of the lobby was incredibly loud, but no problem due to our suite.   However a gathering of incredibly loud, rude teenagers whose director used a BULLHORN at 9pm at night to address the entire hotel of teenagers was the last straw for us. We had a two week reservation...we left 5 nights in.  \n\nAdditional issues with this property: the concierge lounge is very, very limited. Every other Marriott (including most Courtyards) have coffee and tea in the lounge throughout the day, not to mention during the cocktail/dessert hours. At this one, there is none during the day, and, most frustrating, in the evening you have to ask the concierge to provide you with a cup of coffee or hot water. Not at all convenient for a business traveller who takes calls in the lounge. Plus the coffee is not high quality. The attendants were very kind, but just not a well executed lounge in comparison to other properties.\n\nI also want to thank the management who alerted housekeeping when we were leaving in the morning to service our room for the last couple days we were there. Prior to that, the room was not being serviced until about 2:30pm, which is our daughters naptime, and she was along with us on this trip. It was a little frustrating.  As for the ACTUAL service, it was hit or miss. One day was great, replenished our towels, toiletries, took out the trash. Another time our daughters blankets were thrown into a ball in the corner of the bedroom, zero toiletries replenished, and two of her toys that were drying in the bathroom were thrown away. A call for extra towels went without towels ever materializing one night.  Also, the in-room fridge does not fully work, and our hummus, juices, and other snacks were spoiled. \n\nI get that this is the area's biggest conference center, so maintaining business is not a problem for them. However, for those of us who travel frequently and experience many Marriott properties, this one does not come up to scratch, but again, the friendly demeanor of most employees we encountered did help the spotty service of this hotel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

Nothing outstanding, but it is nice to have a window to look at something besides a brick wall.  You get a parking lot view but you get motion.  \n\nThe banquet rooms were gorgeous.

Not a huge hill, but enough to make the walk precarious during these icy times.  Perhaps a little more salt could be expended for visitors.  The location is nice as it is near restaurant and a mall.

It is about 1/4 mile off the beltline and just outside of Madison (by one highway exit).  \n\nIf you want to stay in Madison but avoid the high prices of downtown and the congestion of rush hour, this is the place to be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

I recently attended an evening Board meeting and a one-day conference at this hotel.\n\nThe majority of the sales and catering staff at the Marriott were wonderful to work with.  This was the first time we hosted at event at this location.  The responsiveness of the staff was superb in setting up the event.  There were proactive in keeping our group on track with logistical issues leading up to the event.  On the day of the event, they checked in on us frequently and promptly addressed any concerns our group had.\n\nWe had some problems with the reservations agents indicating that no rooms were available at the conference rate.  The other problem has to do with the layout of the conference rooms.  There is one conference room (the Monona Room) located by the front desk, far away from all the other meeting rooms.  On the day before the event, you guessed it; the Marriott staff moved us to that room.  The calendar of events is not conspicuous, so on the day of the event, all the conference attended entered the facility through the conference center doors and wandered about searching for the Monona Room.\n\nLike most conference facility, the food was a mixed bag.\n\nThings I liked:\n* I enjoyed the caesar salad served with lunch with fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), tangy dressing and herbed croutons that did not go overboard with the salt or garlic.\n\n* Other than the overcooked noodles, the penne pasta with mushroom, spinach, goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted red pepper cream was a well-executed dish.\n\n* While the filling had a bit too much citrus flavor, kudos to the kitchen staff for serving us a cannoli with a crunchy shell, a rarity on the conference food circuit.\n\nThings I didn't:\n* The rigatoni with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and arriabiatta sauce lacked the finesse of the aforementioned penne pasta dish.  With its mushy noodles, overcooked sauce and under-seasoned sausage, there was little to like.\n\n* If you enjoy a heavy does of garlic powder on bread with the texture of a teething biscuit, you would love the garlic bread served with the pasta course.\n\n* My least favorite dish was toasted cheese sandwich served during the planning session the day before the conference.  For $14.95, I expected aged cheddar served on gently grilled slices of artisan sourdough bread.  What I received was very different.  Served barely warm, the bread was soaked in butter and toasted to a brick-like texture that left cuts on the roof of my mouth.  The institutional grade cheddar and provolone cheese had started to congeal by the time the staff served it to me.  The server did not check in with us because she didn't want to interfere with our meeting, preventing me from sending this dish back for a replacement.  The roasted tomato soup, though cool, was the redeeming feature of my meal.\n\nOverall, the experience with the Marriott Madison West was A-OK, based on the positive interactions with the staff, which offset the spotty food quality.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

I've stayed in Madison plenty of times for work, and overall, this is the nicest hotel that I've stayed at.  Pros: staff are very nice and friendly.  Hotel has gym, pool, and business center at no additional cost.  You know how some hotels have that teeny tiny kiosk to print your boarding pass, and that's all you can do?  There are 2 computers hooked up to printers so can you do real tasks like check your email, Yelp, etc.  The beds are VERY comfortable.  It shocked me how nice they were.  Bathrooms have stone countertops and something heating the mirror, so that after a shower your mirror is still usable, not all fogged up.  Someone had their thinking hat on.  The hotel is walkable to several restaurants & I think they provide room service, but they will also help you order from a nearby restaurant if you arrive late in the evening.\n\nFor a hotel this size, they do a really good job with breakfast.  It's a buffet with the usual cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal, pastries, and hot food.  But they really go an extra mile on the eggs, and every egg dish is cooked to order.  Whether you want 1 scrambled egg or full omelette, they'll make it for you fresh, give you a table tent number, and then bring it to you.\n\nI have 2 more trips this year to Madison, and hope I'm staying here again!", "type": "review", "business_id": "MBQc_jlZ3nlMOZy7SUM_5Q"}

Firstly, breakfast stops at 11:00 on weekdays and noon on the weekends, NOTE THAT because when we showed up today after my husbands late night shift the night before they would not serve us breakfast.\n\nCASH OR CHECK ONLY\n\nWorth noting, both menus are pretty slim, but breakfast is larger than lunch.  \n\nThey were out of the fried chicken \"dinner\" (you mean lunch, since they were only open till 2, right?). We ended up ordering the patty melt, ok, fish sandwich, subpar, and onion rings, good but not $3 good. Sandwiches come with chips, not fries.  But was definitely not the pancakes that everyone else was raving about that I was craving.  The coffee was sting but a bit bitter. The total was just under $20 without tip. \n\nThe decor is old, doesn't bother me too much, but looking at the filthy carpets, it was disgusting and I was a bit afraid since I was wearing flat sandals.  Before I forget to mention it, the place smells like smoke when you first walk in, I was completely expecting to see ashtrays at the booths.\n\nThe service was excellent... If you are a regular. If not, plan on spending about three times too much there. We waited for about 5 minutes for our waitress ( one of the owners) to shout sit where you want.  We grabbed a table. My husband had to take a work call, but had given me his order. After waiting 10 minutes, I had to flag our waitress down to place our orders, and she looked at me shocked that I would want something to eat. Trying to get the check out of her was terrible. By 12:15 the lunch regulars had started coming in, so she was chatting about a recent wedding, showings hem the wedding pictures, talking about what the place looked like, etc. by 12:30 I had out cash on the end of the table hoping to move things along.  She walked past us three times without making eye contact, finally, I put my arm out and asked for the check, which had not been prepared, wait for another 5 minutes while she served more regulars and FINALLY she got back to using we were out of there by 12:50. \n\nIn short, we will never return.  It is expensive for what you get, food is unremarkable, serve is terrible, and it seemed like it could use a food service inspection because it was pretty dirty.", "type": "review", "business_id": "X47o6R2rWiqGqvBtC7VS3Q"}

True, Dick isn't around much - but in his defense, he's probably been cutting hair for 50+ years, so he deserves some time away.\n\nThat said, I've gone back twice since my last review (my hair grows fast), and every cut has been absolutely stellar.  Ka, who has cut my hair the last two times, is absolutely wonderful.  Very attentive, very helpful, extremely friendly, and really knows how to cut hair.  \n\nThe place seems to thrive on walk-ins, so don't bother making an appointment.  I think that trying to schedule an appointment is the only downside to Dick & Arnie's... and, it was my only source of frustration.  As soon as I accepted the fact that it's best to just walk-in, life has been great.\n\nSet aside 30-40 minutes and walk-in.  Your haircut will take 15-20 minutes, tops; the extra time is \"cushion\" just in case the place is full.  Don't worry about who does your hair - everyone there seems to know exactly what they're doing, and they do it well.\n\n$15 for a stellar haircut?  No brainer.

Fish was solid - nicely done, especially for the price and speed.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nI'd never visited the Middleton Sport Bowl prior to today, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  We arrived exactly at noon, parked, and made our way to the bar, where we found two seats and were promptly greeted by a bartender.\n\nWe both ordered the lunch special - 2 piece deep fried cod plate with fries, slaw, tartar, dinner roll, and soda.  The bartender took our order and came back with a complimentary bowl of popcorn, which was a nice surprise.\n\nPlates arrived about 10 minutes later - the fish was appropriately sized, as were the fries - no imbalance, and portions were fair.\n\nThe fish itself had a flavorful beer batter that was a little thicker than what you'll typically find at most places, but it was delicious and I welcomed the extra crunch.\n\nInside, the fish itself was a tad watery with just a hint of grease - not anything outrageous, but just enough to sense that it was there.  Flavor of the fish was incredibly mild; the batter stole some of its thunder.  \n\nThe fries were excellent - battered-style and straight cut.  I'm told the slaw and tartar were \"average.\"  Dinner roll was hard and dry.\n\nTotal lunch bill for two: $14.64, and we were in-and-out within 35 minutes.  Totally acceptable and a good lunch, all things considered.\n\nMiddleton Sport Bowl = NEUTRAL\n\nFood = 2.75 to 3 stars (average; not bad, not spectacular)\nService = 3.5 stars (prompt and friendly)\nValue = 4 stars \nMISC = 3 stars (actually seemed to be a nice bowling alley/bar)\n\nSummary: Not a win, nor a fail.

I'll briefly break down how I gauge them (I've been many times, both before and after the renovation)\n\nFacility:  Great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with TVs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments.\n\nCost:  Fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, I think it's around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes.  I'm sure it's hiked up otherwise.  Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option.  We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them.\n\nFood:  It's typical bar food.  They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you'd see at an alley.  Nothing to write home about but if you're in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won't go wrong.\n\nService:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter.  There's a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you're there.  Everytime I've gone in I've tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like \"I'd like to get a lane, there's 3 of us and we all need shoes\" etc, etc.  These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn't help either party move the process along.  It's really irritating because I've gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it's always been like that.  The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don't share the same attitude.\n\nPersonally I'm more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lN-5-YTsaJr_IByyA476iw"}

Some co-workers had been raving about them, and ever the skeptic, I had to verify the claims for myself.\n\nArrived at around noon on a Friday, and copped-a-squat at one of the numerous bar stools.  A very friendly bartender walked over, menu in hand, and asked what I'd like to drink.  I ordered an iced tea, and browsed the menu.\n\nTea arrived within a minute, and I placed my order: cheese curds and a bacon cheeseburger, with pepper jack, cooked medium, please.\n\nThe bartender left with my order, and I passed the time by watching the Big-10 basketball tournament and gazing around at the large and expansive bar area.\n\nThe food arrived, and it looked spectacular.  Let's start with the curds.\n\nFriends, I know curds.  Believe me.  You can read all you want about the \"awwwesome\" and \"amaaaaaazing\" curds from the Old Fashioned - those suck.  Point blank - they suck.  They're greasy, they're usually over-cooked, and they're bland.\n\nWhat \"saves\" the OF's curds is their tiger sauce.  And I don't care who you are, but to borrow from another reviewer, \"Sauce does not a good curd make\" (sorry Doctress, I saw your line in the El Tigre review, and had to borrow it).  \n\nThe Sport Bowl's curds are DEFINITELY homemade.  You can tell simply by looking at them that these offerings begin as simple, unbreaded curds, are battered and rolled in a breading (probably Cornflake or cracker?), and then carefully deep-fried.\n\nAnd the result speaks for itself.  They are EXCELLENT.  So good (see photo).  The bartender confirmed they take 'bare' curds, and give 'em the batter/breading treatment, all to order.  I believe him.  You need to believe me - these are the best curds you'll find outside of Green County.\n\nThe burger was equally excellent, and I'm going to go on record to say the burgers here are without a doubt in the Top 3 for Madison-area burgers.  \n\nKnoche's Market supplies the beef.  It's hand-pattied and grilled to perfection.  I asked for medium and received a true medium burger.  The burger wasn't dry and it wasn't greasy.  It had a delicious smokey, charcoaled flavor that instantly brought back memories of mid-summer grill-nights back home...\n\nThe pepperjack had a nice kick, and the bacon served as pork-icing on the cow cake (I'd have said 'beef cake' but that's a bit over-the-top).\n\nThe bun was light and airy - very fresh tasting and lightly toasted.  \n\nThe burger was so good that I'd have no problem eating it completely plain - burger and bun alone.  That's saying something.\n\nMiddleton SportBowl = WIN\n\nFood = 4.75 stars\nValue = 4.5 stars\nService = 4 stars\nMISC = 3.5 stars (not super inviting environment, but it's a bar/bowling alley)\n\nSummary:\n- Best curds in Madison\n- Top 3 burger in Madison-area\n- Go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lN-5-YTsaJr_IByyA476iw"}

If the shoes fit, the ball rolls down the lane, and the pins fall down, it's fine.\n\nThis review is all about the food.  Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.  Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point.  \n\nWhen you think bar food, you think burgers.  And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent.  Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful \"contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained\" feeling afterwards.  \n\nA quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish.  The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  The \"Philly\" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.\n\nThe best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.  But it will probably cost more than your entire meal here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lN-5-YTsaJr_IByyA476iw"}

The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it... \n\nFirst off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. \n\nThe BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato. \n\nTo give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think. \n\nOver all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! I realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but I've had MUCH better casual dining experiences...for less money!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IEmqrFe96NOhU07TA0rZdw"}

Unfortunately, that's about all it has to offer, unless you enjoy food that is extremely greasy, and of mediocre quality.\n\nDetailed review: Our fish fry crew decided to give Stamm House a try after we'd read good things about it on a fairly well known fish fry review website.  Normally, those guys (the reviewers) are pretty spot on, but they've completely missed the mark when it comes to the Stamm House.  Not even close to being a top-10 place, no way, no how.\n\nWe sauntered in to the Stamm House at around 5:45 on Friday night and were shocked to find the place darned-near empty.  The bartender greeted us immediately - very friendly guy - we ordered a couple of New Glarus Nakeds and a Spotted Cow.  After downing the first round, we went to order a refill, and whoops - Naked went empty, and there wasn't any more left.  Drat.\n\nAfter downing a second round of beers (Cows all around this time), it dawned on us that we probably needed to inquire about a table.  So, we wandered upstairs where a friendly lady told us she'd have an opening at around 6:45 or 7:00.  Odd, the place was empty... but, we took it and went back downstairs.\n\nWe ordered some cheese curds and the onion rings.  The bartender warned us ahead of time that the curds were \"standard-from-the-bag\" curds, but said the rings were hand-battered and delicious.  They arrived quickly, and once again, the bartender was spot-on with his description.\n\nThe curds were Sysco curds and were not cooked well at all.  I don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn't eat them.  Disgusting.  And the ranch dipping sauce was like water... you know what they say about oil and water... \n\nThe rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous.  It really made for a bad first impression.  So, we ordered some Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes.  \n\nOur table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed.  Where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery... our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side.\n\nDinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size.  Fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns.  First bite of the fish?  UGH - it tasted awful.  Extremely fishy flavor (and I love fish).  Think \"stinky NJ ocean shore line flavor\" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable.  No sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  \n\nSo, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup.  That helped a bit, but it still wasn't an enjoyable fish fry.  The fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered.  If only it weren't so obscenely fishy...   \n\nHash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty).  Service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us.  Total bill for three with a round or two of drinks was $45-ish.\n\nStamm House = FAIL\n\nFood: 1 star (grease, grease everywhere; horrible fish fry)\nService: 4.5 stars \nValue: 3 stars\n\n\nSummary: waaaaay too greasy + waaaaaay too fishy fish = fail.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IEmqrFe96NOhU07TA0rZdw"}

The best part is that if you get there at any time other than lunchtime, you get fresh fries.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is how they put mayo on some of their burgers, but they never have a problem with making one without mayo.  Service is always friendly, but sometimes a little slow.  Oh yeah, you should also stay away from the chicken strips.  They're bad.\n\nThe decor here is awesome, with wood paneling straight out of the 80's and cheap plastic booths.  There's even a sterile-looking wall clock on one of the walls.

The bartender was ON - never missed a beat, never left our glasses empty, and was very helpful.  5+ stars.\n\nDrinks? Limited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items: Great Lakes Ale and Esthers Best were two that stood out as fun and not what you'd normally find at a more mainstream location.  They also have daily drink specials - we tried the Lemon Smash (hand squeezed (with each drink) lemonade + vodka) and the Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  Both were great.\n\nFood? We tried the famous chili - meaty, slightly spicy, and delish.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means.  We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality.  \n\nFor our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty.  Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet).  The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I'd get it again in a heartbeat!  \n\nOur dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce.  The result?  Wow - tasty, especially if you're a fan of vinegar-based wing sauce that packs a bit of a kick.  Really, really good.\n\nSo, we'll definitely be back - I'm becoming a huge fan of the \"local\" places, and the Village Green is definitely a \"local\" place.

My all-time favorite is their summer sausage reuben...if you love reubens you cannot go wrong with this jewel!  Fries are always hot and fresh and service is always friendly.

All new equipment and works great. \n\nI have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. \n\nI have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. \n\nI have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!\n\nI have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.\n\nThe only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot.

Furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, Although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.\n\nA receptionist named Deeon, was at the front desk when I last entered Tangles. He welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. He seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. I waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room I was unfortunate enough to have been next to. As I was waiting, I noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. There were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.\n\nOn the plus side, Tangles does have some talented stylists. But without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.\n\nI wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. It is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. However, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that Tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mbtGl2I2A2To-8jiggN99g"}

I made the appointment and the day before the appointment they contacted me to  tell me that the nail tech that I was scheduled with called in sick.  When I stated that my appointment was for the next day at 11:30 , they indicated that she was going to be out then as well.  Ok, I was fine with this, and they offered to get me in at 2:00 or 3:00.   I indicated that I would have to check my calendar and would call them right back, but she put me in  for 3:00 temporarly.  I called back 10 minutes later to let them know that I could not make 3:00 work due an appointment I had at work and would need to have my pedicure at 2:00.  This was done via voice mail and asked them to call me back to confirm this was still available.  I did not receive a call back, and followed up with a new call to Tangles the following morning, which was the day of my appointment and I left a new voice mail message to confirm that they received my previous voice mail and please call me back.   I did not receive a call, so one would assume that they had me down for 2:00.  I took a late lunch from work, and drove over to their location on Whitney Way which is a good 20 minute drive and when I arrived, was told they had me down for 3:00 and that they were booked and could not get me at 2:00.   At this point I was very frustrated, due to the lack of not responding to my voice mail messages. The receptionist told me she was aware of my calls, but did not have the time to call me back, since they were so busy.    This took an hour of my day, and a gallon of gas to drive there, and  was not offered any  compensation for their lack of not informing me that they were now booked at 2:00, even though I told them I would call right back to confirm either 2:00 or 3:00.      This is the poorest customer service I have ever recieved by far from a salon!!   I wonder how they plan on staying in business, when they treat clients in this matter and have no regard for their time and money, ($3.80 a gallon for gas).  I understand that sometimes it is necessary to adjust an appointment, but the lack of respect for my time is over the top for me.   Also when a salon signs up to offer a Group On deal, I would assume the goal for  doing this is to try and build their business wth new clients.   If they do not have the capablity to handle new clients, then they should not be offering this type of promotion.     Not A New Client!", "type": "review", "business_id": "mbtGl2I2A2To-8jiggN99g"}

I received a shellac manicure, partial highlight and conditioning treatment and based on what I spent on the Living Social coupon I am satisfied with the results, but if I had paid full price for these services I would be very dissatisfied.  \n\nThere was just something \"off\" about my entire experience at Tangles.  The salon and nail room looked messy and unorganized, as did most of the hair stylists and nail technicians.  I didn't get that \"Aveda vibe\" at all, more like the \"Cost Cutters vibe\" (nothing against CC, but if I'm paying $75 for highlights I'd like the atmosphere to match the price).

Both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy.  The music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful.  The wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance.  With all of these elements going for it, I have high expectations for the food.  Although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when I've dined there.\n\nI have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers.  The bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites.  The tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto.  The fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior.  The mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don't come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten.  Our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce.\n\nTwo of my companions ordered the Ravioli al Vin Santo; both liked and finished the dish.  It is one of four vegetarian options (the Fettucini alla Putenesca does not list meat, but I've never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom I dined.  One companion ordered the Insalata di Caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative.  A fourth companion ordered the Lasagna del Giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite.  A fifth companion ordered the Fettucini alla Putenesca, of which I tried a bite.  The spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty.  My entree, the Campenelli il Diavolillo, was pretty awful.  The combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and Italian sausage.  The sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic.  It clashed notably with the rest of the dish.  The shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy.  The pasta was fresh and tasty.  It was really a shame that the \"spicy garlic broth\" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible.  All portions were huge.\n\nThe desserts are delicious.  The tiramisu, which I sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet.  I tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us.  Since we arrived at 5 p.m., this came as quite a shock.  It seems unlikely that they started the evening's service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning.  The bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon.\n\nI can't say I'll be back anytime soon.  I have to disagree with Zenide R.'s assertion that it's \"easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.\"  For the price, both Lombardino's and Tutto Pasta make better Italian food, and I shall stick to those restaurants in the future.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg"}

Their italian sausage is probably the best we've had anywhere (including fancy places in LA, NYC, Philly, etc).\n\n There are special lasagna, fish, and ravioli dishes every night. The lasagna is cooked to order so it takes a while, but is so worth it. If you are lucky enough to go on an Italian sausage lasagna night, the portion is enormous, and every bite (yes, every bite) includes sausage and cheese - it's the bomb. I had a veal ravioli in a butter sage sauce recently that was fabulous, and unlike some pricey new Italian places where the portion is 5 or so ravioli, this dish had 10 or 12 large ones. In fact, all the portions are large, and really reasonably priced. Their wine selection is pretty sparse, and we haven't had good look finding one we like. But that is the only down side to what is always a fantastic and totally filling meal.  \n\nWe are usually too full for dessert, but they do make their own tiramisu, which is light, fluffy, creamy, and enormous.

There were three in a our party.  When she asked if we had reservations, I replied no,  and she commented NO?  You KNOW IT IS SATURDAY.  I wanted to say yes, yesterday was Friday and tomorrow is Sunday.  Instead I replied that I was TERRIBLY sorry i did not realize i needed a reservation, and she once again reminded me it was SATURDAY.  I had never been there and did not realize that it was a quaint, small place.  Had I known, I would certainly made a reservation.  I probably will not make a reservation and try the menu since the hostess obviously thought I did not know what day it was.  Yes, it is probably my loss, but I don't enjoy being insulted.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg"}

They need to drag folks in, so they make you play, come hell or high water.  I've heard rumors of sand volleyball...in the snow.  Maybe I'm just bitter. cold.\n\nThe food is nothing worth writing home about.  The sandwiches are pretty standard fare and nachos are decent.  I'm a sucker for seasoned fries and they're pretty decent here, so I'll add another star.  Unfortunately, the beer isn't cheap, nor were there other obvious specials.  Look around and find somewhere else if you're out for an evening of drinking.\n\nThe TVs aren't all that great for a sports bar, which the Club Tavern tries to achieve, as far as I can tell.  There is a projector and large screen, but I haven't seen it used.They've got a couple of pool tables and dartboards as well.\n\nThe bartenders aren't terrible, it just takes some time for them to warm up to you.

None of us had ever been there.\nWhile the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first \"real\" meal you've had in ages.  To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.\n\nWe arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.\n\nI ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.\nFriend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.\n\nAfter the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.\n20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said \"oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\"\n5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\"\n5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.\n\nThey were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.\n\nFinally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:\nFish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.\nFries: Were best part of the meal.\nTartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.\nColeslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.\n\nOrdered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.\n\nWe were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.\nHe came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.\n\nFinishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.\n\nMaybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.\n\nThe best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.\n\nWe  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.\n\n30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.\n\ngirlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.  Also noted her old fashioned came w cherries and olives in it, which is taboo? Supposed to be one or other?

Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.\n\nDetailed review:\nI've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a \"Meh.\"  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning.\n\nI wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer.  I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.\n\nA waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.\n\nBreakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).\n\nThe waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the \"Hen's Nest\" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  We were in business.  \n\nBefore leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns.  I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nFood came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  I found myself wishing I had ordered 2.  \n\nThe Hen's Nest was just \"OK\" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough... I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  \n\nThe multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the Hen's Nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.\n\nService = 2 stars (nothing great)\nFood = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)\nValue = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)\nMISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)\n\nI'd really like to give C's 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star \"gift\" rating.  Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars... :-)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price.  It'll probably be a while before I visit C's again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "B0Vuwn6Hugc-0U5n31YBfg"}

(This made me happy, as I like meat at breakfast after a night of rainy camping, but am allergic to pork.) The skillet had turkey, potatoes, onions and green peppers mixed together, with toast and 2 eggs on top. The eggs were perfect, which impressed me, given how crazy busy the place was. I do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste. In fact, the onions were damn near raw. Luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but I take away a star for that .\n\n(BF says his potatoes were underdone too. Not raw, but not quite done enough.)\n\nWaitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled. And, since it was a bakery, we HAD to at least try a cinnamon roll.  It was a good roll, and they even warmed it up for us. \n\nI noticed that they had a LOT of baked goods specializing with Strawberry and Rhubarb, which is in season right now. To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb. Tends to indicate a reliance on seasonal (and hopefully locally grown) produce. \n\nIt being Father's day, they had a special on Steak and Eggs and a fresh berry topped waffle special too.

Not a bad deal; they just need to make the beers at the bar cheaper so you can leave with a smile on your face.\n\nI believe they do tours on the weekends at 1:30 and 3:30, and they do offer then during weekdays.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Wn8NhS-L1ck6jbTjX88Kkg"}

I've never done the tour or hung out in the Bier Stube, though they're both on my list, but between Memorial Day and Halloween I try to make my way over to Terrace Avenue as often as possible.  It's also become somewhat of a tradition amongst my friends to go to Bockfest in February as well as wait in line for Great Taste tickets in May.  These are good times in their own regard, but the best times I've had here are just the random summer nights spent sitting at a picnic table with friends or watching a band playing on stage.  On weekend nights during the summer the place gets packed, especially if a band is playing.  And while it's pretty easy to find Capital beers on tap or at stores throughout the area, nothing beats fresh from the brewery.  As an added bonus, you can often get the seasonals or other less prominent beers on tap here as opposed to the bottles prevalent elsewhere.  This past summer my go-to was the Wild Rice Lager, as well as the Supper Club lager on the really hot nights.  There's even a few wine choices for the non-beer drinking crowd, including Wollersheim's Prairie Fume.  \n\nI've got a decent history going on with the Bier Garten, as this was one of the places I went on my 21st birthday.  My buddy purchased me one of the half-liter plastic mugs as my birthday present.  I've still got it to this day, and I bring it with every time I go out.  Suffice it to say, however much that mug cost has been more than offset by the reduced cost per ounce offered by the mug.  If you're planning on coming back I definitely recommend making the investment.  It beats the regular 16 oz plastic cups and I'd hazard a guess it's comparable to getting a pitcher, without the necessity of coming to agreement on what beer to order.\n\nThere isn't any food service whatsoever, but it's perfectly fine to bring in your own with you.  My personal go-to is Gino's, but there's plenty of places nearby and I believe you can ask for take-out menus of local restaurants up at the counter.  I've even ordered Falbo's for delivery pizza a couple times - just meet them outside the gate by road.  Capital's also put up a large tent over most of the picnic tables, which helps when the weather is inclement.  Mosquitoes are an issue, especially as the sun goes down, but this is Wisconsin so you've got to expect that.  The place closes down at 9:00 PM in deference to the residential nature of the area, which actually is a blessing in many ways.  On weekends it's a great start to the evening, and I really don't need to be staying out that late on weeknights anymore.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Wn8NhS-L1ck6jbTjX88Kkg"}

The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table.

Crikey - I'm losing it, I tell 'ya.\n\nNo visit to the Madison area would be complete without stopping-by the Capital Brewery.  During the spring/summer/fall months, their beer garden is phenomenal.  It's a large, trellised, open area that's sun-protected compliments of a huge blue tent cover/awning.  \n\nPicnic tables galore, it makes for an ideal location to chill with friends and family.  Bring along whatever type of food you'd like, because they don't serve food here.  Or, better yet, call one of the many local restaurants and request delivery - most of them service the brewery.  Dogs are more than welcome, as are kids. \n\nA large stage frames the eastern side of the garden; you'll find live music on most Friday and Saturday nights.  They used to show movies on Saturday nights, but I believe that has come to pass.\n\nThe staff is always excellent.  You won't find a nicer group of folks no matter how far or hard you search.  Kyle's the absolute best - the guy is unbelievably friendly, funny, and knows everything about the brews.  He often serves as the brewery tour guide, so pay attention if he suggests you try a certain brew.\n\nDuring the colder months, the indoor stube is warm and inviting.  There's a large flat screen television for game watching, and plenty of comfy seating.  The stube operates on reduced hours during the winter months, and just a heads-up that it's often times rented/reserved for private events (think holiday parties), so check their website schedule prior to planning a spur-of-the-moment visit.\n\nThe gift shop is nice, with a great selection of glasses, shirts, and other goodies.  Prices are more than reasonable.  The bathrooms are usually spotless, which is a bonus.\n\nSo... if you haven't been to the brewery, make it a priority to visit.  Stop by on a Saturday or Sunday and take the tour (it's only a couple of dollars, includes samples, and runs hourly), then spend time enjoying some of Capital's great beers.

Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  \n\nThat said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.\n\nI called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (\"PD\" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.\n\nSo imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \"any old oil\" while on the phone.  When I tried to correct him and request the 505.01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved.\n\nI then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter.  I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused.  A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer.\n\nSo, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership.  I'm sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and I was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25).", "type": "review", "business_id": "uyp8kpTXKfKXvAB8HdJSAA"}

For the last year or so the food has been slipping and become mediocre - including, this fall, the worst plate of spaghetti I've ever been served in a restaurant (by an employee who is no longer there), but our experience on Saturday pretty much finished our long relationship with Deli Roma.\n\nWe arrived around 4:30 p.m. and there was no one else in the deli. A young man was seated behind the register and greeted us, but did not get up. We saw the specials board had an item which was a play on the Godfather, their signature Italian roast beef sandwich, and discussed whether we'd want to try it. During all this the gentleman behind the counter remained seated but appeared to be paying attention.\n\nWhen I said we were ready to order he got up, but when I ordered a Godfather he said that they were out of Italian beef. I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients.\n\nIf he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business.

When the Gyro arrived, it reeked of rotten deer carcass, the plate was filthy and the fries were colder than Alaska in December.  I'm not joking.  The Gyro tasted so bad that I had to spit a mouthful of it into a napkin and slug down a glass of water to cleanse the horse-s--t taste from my mouth.  \n\nSarah noticed that I hadn't eaten my food, she offered to remove it from the bill with out me asking.  I would normally applaude that gesture, but some older foreign lady (I assume the owner) came over and told her not to do that.  \"I'll make you new sandwich,\" said the old lady. I declined.

I paid my 9 dollars for a lousy cup of liquid Velveeta and left.\n\nI bet the Dairy Queen across the parking lot is glad that Sir Hobo's is back open.

Sadness. Another mom and pop Chinese buffet goes by the wayside of stretching themselves too thin.\n\n\nI resisted going here for the past several years that I've lived in Sun Prairie b/c of all the other mediocre Chinese food buffet restaurants I've eaten at that left me a bit disappointed.\n\nTheir selection is less in numbers of dishes than other places around the Dane County area; however, in terms of quality and freshness, it's rather good. Since other reviewers did not go into significant detail about the offerings, I'll mention my first time experience recently on a Sunday (where there were about three other tables of diners):\n\n- peanut butter chicken\n- mongolian beef\n- chow mein\n- a few sushi rolls (x2 varieties)\n- crab rangoons (better than average)\n- spring rolls (eggrolls, more aptly)\n- popcorn shrimp\n- two types of soups - your basic hot and sour or egg drop (these were just OK)\n- chicken skewers (these were excellent even though I didn't expect them to be based on appearance)\n- seafood stir fry w/ veggies\n- fish fillets\n- dessert options looked like a few types of cakes and fruit, pudding, and jello.\n\nI like the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. And this place was clean.  It's tucked away in a strip mall by Walmart, so points against it for location.  But you can't beat the price, $7-8 for a buffet meal!  Of course, afterwards, I had to nap off the food coma ...", "type": "review", "business_id": "5uxhIGZlJm9g_zfG_83z5Q"}

We love the indoor family and warm water pools. The nursery staff is excellent. I like that when we come in to drop the kids off at the nursery, they greet us by our first names.  I love the infrared sauna they recently put in. \nOne advice I would give to people who are considering of joining is that you don't have to get the most exclusive membership like gold cove, if you are only going to work out on the machines. We have gold cove, the most expensive membership which allows you to have exclusive access to outdoor water park during summer and most of the group fitness classes offered in the club but we hardly go to group fitness class and hardly go to outdoor water park. The water temperature is still cold even it is 80 degrees out. This past summer, we went to the outdoor water park maybe two- three times the most and stayed out no more than half hour. So, it really isn't worth to have a gold cove unless you know you are looking for specific classes with GC membership. \nThe parking and getting the machine to work out can be a problematic during winter months between 4:30-7:00PM. Sometime, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for the machine to free. If that's the case, you can go sit in the sauna until some people leave. So, I would suggest go there early in the morning or late in the evening but then if you are bringing along your little ones you run into problems with daycare after nursery is closed. They have a restaurant that offers supposedly healthier food but we never had any luck with the food there.

Lots and lots of cardio equipment + 4 different weight areas\n3. Indoor soccer field, track, basketball courts, and racquetball courts\n4. Lots of classes - aerobics, swimming, spinning, etc\n5. Outdoor pools with waterpark\n6. Childcare\n\nCons\n1. Expensive membership with required 2 year contract\n2. You only have access to all the things listed above under the Pros section if you have the Gold Cove membership, which is the most expensive package.  Regardless of having the most expensive membership, you still have to pay extra for most of the classes.  \n3. If you have anything less than the Gold Cove membership, there is one older woman at the front desk, as you check in, who will look at you like you're trying to steal the tanning bed she lives in.  However, there is also a younger one with long, dark hair, who is more of an equal opportunity offender.  She'll treat you like crap, no matter what your status.\n4. If you don't have Gold Cove forget about going to the waterpark, unless you want to pay 23 dollars per person to get in.  \n5. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT bring in any of your own food.  If they catch you anywhere in the facility with so much as a pretzel stick, they will go off on you, thusly informing you that you can only consume food and beverages purchased at THEIR lounge/bar/crappy food place.  Because you know, you might be trying to smuggle in crack cocaine with your pretzels. \n6. Lounge/bar area serves you the crappiest, overpriced food you can find.  I don't know about the bar because I didn't go to a health club to drink.  \n7. Parking is a nightmare, especially in the mornings, and right around the time people are coming home from work.  While that is to be expected, the countless number of SUVs and big pick ups with something to prove, stalking people as they head to their vehicles makes for a dangerously crowded, and highly annoying situation.\n\nThere you have it.

So allow me to begin again.\n\nThis Walmart location is one of the teeny tiny, original designs.  The parking lot has so many huge dips and holes I sometimes think I am being forced to go spelunking in my car.  \n\nThe old lady greeters at the front door are my favorite part of the experience because they remind me of grandma.  But they would probably mace me if I tried to run up and give them a hug.  \n\nThey have a fabric department, which seems to be a feature that the newer, super walmarts are missing.  Unfortunately, the store is usually running a skeleton crew most of the time, so it's hard to find an employee in that section of the store who knows how to cut some fabric.  \n\nMost of the employees here are like most of the employees at any Walmart, underpaid, and overworked.  So it doesn't bother me too much when they frown at me.  I've been on the other side of the register before, so I know how soul crushing it can be.  Though, they may not be frowning at me because of that reason, they probably just know I'm an incredible dufus.  \n\nHowever, there is one employee there who is usually cashiering, and has this wonderful Russian accent.  She's also very friendly and cheery.  The other day she was telling me about growing her own basil, freezing it in ice cube trays with chicken stock, and then plopping the cubes in rice later on for flavoring.  Tricky, tricky!  \n\nAnyway, I guess I am more impressed by the larger Walmart in Monona that has the shopping cart escalators.  I could stand there all day and launch carts down that thing, it really revs up the dork in me.  \n\nBut in the meantime, if I don't feel like heading over that way I could just stop at this Walmart to get maced by the grannies and listen to cooking recipes from Nina.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tZbKiggbDGeBpGnOYk0Syw"}

The employees at this location vary from indifferent to pretty helpful. The cashiers are mostly the former. Having done that exact job, I can relate.  \n\nThey have a couple of small aisles with food stuffs (bread, cereal) and there are coolers in the front with milk and OJ, which is wonderful when all you need is some cheap fabric, a gallon of milk, and a tube of mascara. \n\nThere are plans to build a new Wal-Mart right behind this one, then demolish this one and turn it into parking lot.

No big deal, right? Except that both cars sat and waited for a few minutes. I thought the first car was disabled because it sat there so long. \n\nThe store itself is fine. It's a Super Walmart, so it has the grocery store side. It's a lot like the one in Monona, but without the fun underground parking (best thing I've ever seen in a Walmart) and escalator. I tried to check out using the self-checkout because it is faster when I only have ten items or so. Well, this self-checkout machine was troublesome. It kept telling me I had unauthorized items in bagging area (uh, it was the item I'd just slid over the laser) and then it said I had a restricted item and needed cashier approval to finish up and pay. I didn't have any alcohol, bullets, weapons, or cigarettes. I had a 2-pack of lighters, which was probably it, but why? At any rate, the guy monitoring the self-checkout had to come over and help me three different times. This was in no way faster than just going through a regular register. \n\nThe cashier who helped me to checkout and a guy I asked about Nutella were both nice, but it was an overall frustrating experience.

All the other employees are stretched as thin as possible to cover the rest of the store.  I'm in sporting goods, I need a fishing license.  Nope.

We read and reviewed the contract, gave her a non-refundable deposit check and we were in the booking book!\n\nMy daughter Dylilah and I reviewed the menu and decided on a buffet style lunch and the vendors I worked with (Cake, Balloons Statues, Slide Show, Lion Dancers, etc.) had no issues having access to the property the day of.\n\nIf you'd like to see how great it turned out and how beautiful Windsor (and my daughter) really is, we've got the video here: http://youtu.be/DCX7KZQCzcE?t=2m8s\n\nNo, they are not inexpensive but, you get what you pay for and truly, I'm sure Lake Windsor will take your wishes and concerns seriously and execute them into an unforgettable time as they did with us!", "type": "review", "business_id": "22UfD-4PEOgXTr6sev5McQ"}

It was nice, but I don't remember a whole lot about it.  I'm more about the golf.\n\nHow you like this course will likely depend on when you go.  If it's been raining recently, or is a \"wet summer\", you'll find several holes are quite soggy.  Greens, fairways, teeboxes - all areas can be affected.\n\nDuring dry periods, like today (it rained 3 days ago), it wasn't bad and the course was in relatively good shape.  I don't know if it was the sunshine or how the rough was cut (or not cut), but it was really hard to spot a ball in areas where it should be easy.  That was frustrating. \n\nThe course layout is nice with some rolling elevation change (nothing drastic) and water in play on many holes.  A few par 4's will make you think about going around or over water for your second shot - that's always fun!\n\nSo, while not my favorite course in in the area, I will golf here often.  It nice enough and if you look around you can find some good deals.  The staff are always very pleasant and helpful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "22UfD-4PEOgXTr6sev5McQ"}

I thought I'd head east and come here for lunch since I didn't find anything better. Years ago, this used to be a place called Stockade and I loved it. Now it's a Badgers/Packers bar and grill. \n\nVisible from I-90, just west of Madison, there's a cheese place (Mouse Haus I believe) and warehouses for Pepsi and Walgreen's nearby. The Rodeside Grill resembles a log cabin style fort from the outside. Years ago, this place used to be called Stockade.\n\nOnce inside, it's quite spacious with high ceilings and an all wood interior, except for the tile on the floor. The whole place looks very clean, not grungy and aged like so many bars in Wisconsin. I sat down to eat at the bar. All along the bar counter, there were blurbs and excerpts of Packers and Badgers accomplishments underneath the laminated countertop. The place even had green-colored ductwork, so I knew I was deep in Packers territory.\n\nA big screen TV aired game highlights from the Packers-Saints NFL season opener from the day before. Large men with mustaches came in for lunch, typical Wisconsin body types. I kept a low profile and my Chicago origin and calmly requested the Friday fish fry special. Having traveled up north on many occasions, this wasn't the first time I was surrounded by Packer fans. It's not hard to deal with them if you don't disclose where you're from and stick to the menu items or make a positive comment about Jordy Nelson being an awesome rising star on the team.\n\nThe fish arrived in a few minutes and it came with a side of fries that were seasoned and coated - quite tasty in fact. Coleslaw is also a can't-miss item north of Illinois and this place has it right too. I found the meal quite enjoyable. The bartender got me another iced tea and then spent a few more minutes of admiring the place. The Packers highlights gave way to NASCAR on the TV, but I was on my way, 150 miles from Chicago once again.\n\nWhile I went for the fish, Rodeside also has some good burgers, from what I saw around me at lunch that day. Worth a stop on your way to the Dells or Lodi for that matter. Just leave the Bears stuff in the car.", "type": "review", "business_id": "O_Pu4mKGOqQVlmH07Zbnhg"}

Went to \"BURGER FI\" two days after it opened, and this is in the same plaza as Joe's on South Val Vista across the street from Dana Park. I WAITED FOR 28 MINUTES FOR  (2) TWO BURGERS AND FRIES. NO SORRY FROM THEM, AND I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO \"BURGER FI\"! Here at Joe's, they cared, looked me into my face, and went the extra mile by giving me the card for next time! if you are looking for \"AWESOME, HEALTHY FOOD\", Tokyo Joe's is the place, and with the article in the Arizona Republic stating the growth the company wants, they will do very well in the Phoenix market.

The aftermath of this is that we all feel like we are going to puke (including the meat-eaters in our parties).\n\nCleanliness: one of the waitresses spilled a drink on my mother and father (and their food). She was very nice and apologized for it, but then it took the entirety of our meal for anyone to clean it up. And we had to ask for napkins and for them to replace our meals.\n\nSupplies: there were no lids for the To-Go cups.\n\nOverall, this was a very poor experience.

That's when I spotted Tokyo Joe's Healthy Asian Grill.  I decided to give it a shot. Should've known I wasn't in for the best Asian dining experience, when I walked in and the place looked like every other new fast food place that have been popping up in the area. Ex: Cafe Rio, Cafe Zupas, etc. Sadly there also wasn't a single Asian person in the place. \n\nOrdering was fairly quick, with sushi, build your own bowl, and a couple pre -designed items. The place offers several different iced tea options, sadly, the first two selections I made were empty. I ordered the gyoza appetizer, ramen noodles, and the aforementioned iced tea. \n\nI'm going to preface this by saying that I grew up in a primarily Asian family, so I hold my Asian foods to a higher standard. That being said, the food sucked. The gyoza's were of the pre packaged store bought variety (or at least the taste and texture suggested that) with a few dried out green onions sprinkled on top. The accompanying dipping sauce was good (ponzu I believe). Ramen was over cooked and bland. The broth had a decent flavor, but was not enough to save the meal. The egg was too over over cooked for my liking. Chicken also seemed pre packaged. \n\nSo here's where they lost a star. Managers take note. If a staff member makes eye contact with a customer, they should at least be acknowledged. ESPECIALLY if the customer says something to them. On my way out the door, one of the employees crossed paths with me. I said excuse me as I made my way by, then said have a nice night. They looked at me as if they were deaf... (If they were actually deaf, I'll retract this part of my review) \n\nEither way, long story short, no I would not recommend this place and will not be back. If you're going out for Asian, there's many places I would recommend, over this one, that are in the area. Try Thai Chili or Simis Cafe instead. \n\nHappy Yelping!", "type": "review", "business_id": "CgYGechEKyViP0kg2DJrJg"}

It's quick and delicious! Prior to Tokyo Joe's opening, I was a regular at Yogi's Grill and let me tell you.... This place puts Yogi's to shame. Like Yogis, you can build a bowl with white chicken, dark chicken, steak, salmon or tofu.  You can choose white rice, brown rice or noodles.  That is where the similarities end. At Yogi's, you can choose teriyaki or spicy teriyaki sauces while at Joe's you can choose from like 8 different sauces. I have had two different ones. The Yakitori sauce is a spicy peanut sauce and is super good. My favorite is the Dragon sauce which is a lil hotter and less sweet than the Yakitori. They claim that the Dragon sauce is made with Habanero peppers which may be true, but it is not Habanero hot. While not as spicy as I was expecting, this sauce is delicious!  When building your own bowl you get to choose which veggies you want in it. The veggies are always fresh and crisp as they are placed in the bowl last. This place also offers many different kinds of sushi. I do not eat sushi so I will not comment on that but the rice or noodle bowls are great.

When we arrived to the restaurant we were greater right away and told we could sit wherever we would like. A bit confused when we first came in because there is not sign, it was nice that a waiter was there when we arrived. Within minutes we were greeted by our waiter, and were given a menu. Minutes after he arrived to take our order. The Passion Fruit Margarita I got was very good, the Pina Colada my husband got he loved. I order the lettuce cups, no shrimp or chicken (I'm Vegan) they were very very good! I was actually full which was nice. My husband got a burger with fries, I do not remember the name of it but it was rare the way he likes and he absolutely loved it. Overall the experience here was great. The staff was friendly, the prices are on point, the food was delicious, and atmosphere nice, and pretty touristy. The menu is slim so not many choice, but satisfying. I will be returning here in the near future on our upcoming stays.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AcLAMiHakgu-DR3YTL0kcQ"}

This place sent out coupons stating to come on down and try out their new location. I showed up to find a closed sign and construction tools were scattered all over the inside. Kind of a disappointment but I figured I'd just check back the following week. When I went back there was a sign on the door stating they would be opening that night. I figured they would need to pull off a miracle because the same tools were all over the place. The sign said they would be open though and the sign wasn't there the previous week so I went back that evening. Same tools everywhere and they weren't open. Someone did show up to at least remove the sign. \n\nA couple weeks later they finally opened. I stopped in to get a mini blizzard with reese's and oreos. I sat at a table and waited about 10 minutes when a girl brought out a dipped cone for me. What? I didn't order that so I showed her my receipt and she said she would make what I ordered right away. She threw away the dipped cone, such a waste, and went to make what I hoped would be what I ordered. As she walked back out, she realized she made a medium blizzard instead of a mini and proceeded to throw it away to go back and make me the right size since I paid for a mini and not a medium. With the waste of the 2 ice creams she threw out I don't see how giving me the medium she mistakenly made to me would have been a big deal.

She offered instead to \"take care of my next time I was in\".  Um..not sure what that entailed but pressed on with my $1 refund.  After another 15 minutes, she returned with $3.

Really! Their little shop is so cute too. Everyone I met on staff here is warm, friendly and encouraged me to try all the flavors they had. It made it so hard for me to decide what I wanted since I liked them all. They are off to a great start so far!\n\nSo here's the inside scoop: \n\n-  It's a family operated biz run by Tanya and Alicia\n- The ice cream sold here is from Downtown San Jose's best kept secret..well except for here on Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/treat-ice-cream-company-san-jose \n \nThe premium ice cream is the real deal. Real meaning no artificial flavorings or preservatives used to enhance the ice cream flavors.High quality ingredients are used to make their ice cream. Fresh fruit was even used for mango and peach ice cream that I tried. Only small batches are sold and when it is gone that's it! \n\nTexture wise.real creamy it's super smooth, not icy/no crystallization.\n \nThe exotic flavors is what got me to check out this place. Taro and Macapuno. I tried several different flavors and ended up ordering these below:\n\nGreen Tea - has a bit more pop in flavor and is refreshing, perfect for the summer season.\n \nTaro - made right from the taro root that they get from the Phillipines. Flavor is hard to describe. For me it's kind of nutty with vanilla tones.\n \nPineapple Coconut, Mango and the Peach flavors have strong fruit flavors.\n \nGive Burgundy Cherry and Pistachio a try too.The flavors are \"wow  that's good!\" kinda good.\n\n A one scoop sundae with toppings will set you back just under five bucks. It might seem a little high for the BR/Thrifty crowd. And why it falls short of five stars overall, but those seeking premium, higher quality ingredients in an ice cream will appreciate what they carry.. Ice cream alone is undoubtedly five stars. I'm just ecstatic they have Taro!\n \nThere is also cold case that has dessert cakes and 'Kronuts'. Hmmm Kronut Ala Mode anyone?\n \nShout out and credit goes to my new Yelper friend Melissa V.!  She checked in on her Yelp app and put it out on blast they carried Filipino flavors! So don't forget to check in on your Yelp app! You get 10% off.\n\nI mentioned the shop is super cute. Ice cream parlourish theme. Hand painted artwork, striped walls in the hallway. The furnishings are cleverly re purposed. All done by co-owner Tanya!\n \nFYI: I missed seeing this place since the trees obscure the view on Eastern Ave. Location is in the same complex that has Windy City Beef, Las Cazuelas, No 1 Boba Tea, just right around the corner from Yummy Sushi. Eis Cream Cafe faces Silverado  ...yeah I KNOW that corner of the Target shopping center just got a little more fattening!", "type": "review", "business_id": "iN0HhYwuF5BhGDDqUPKitQ"}

I saw this place driving down Silverado Ranch Boulevard heading towards Eastern. If you're not paying attention you would miss it as it is in this strip mall alongside some forgettable shops. So forgettable I couldn't even tell you what they were. One day I read about it onYelp and intentionally paid it a visit. I was pleasantly surprised to find tropical/asian ice cream flavors such as Mango, Macapuno, Taro and Green Tea among traditional American flavors. I thought this was awesome because I wouldn't have to drive clear out to  Chinatown or central Vegas also known as Filipino land to get my fix. \nOnce there, I met Olive who gave me heaping scoops of my flavors of choice, Taro and Green Tea. They charge $4.50 for 2 scoops which I thought was fair after seeing what you got for it. They were delicious as expected. Perfect on a hot day.\nThe shop was quaint and clean. Great for a dessert run for the family. They have a little corner in the shop that displays Sanrio merchandise.  They also sold some of the best kinds of cronuts you will taste. So next time you have an ice cream craving, go see Olive. She'll take care of you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iN0HhYwuF5BhGDDqUPKitQ"}

Taro has a slight texture where you can feel the \"grainy-ness\" of the root in the ice cream. Macapuno (young coconut) has actual pieces of young coconut (like what you'd get from inside a young coconut). \n\nThese two are my favorite. Not too sweet. Good flavoring. \n\nGreen tea was a little disappointing. Not too strong in green tea flavor (im a sucker for strong tea flavor hence why i like Cafe Teaze's teas) \n\nHeath Bar Ice cream was good too ! nice to get some good sized bite pieces in the ice cream for you to be surprised by and enjoy :D \n\nCookies and cream is very well made.

The coconut pineapple was like a scoop of heaven, in a pretty glass ice cream dish.\n\nThey will offer you a taste of any of ice creams they have.  Not on those little plastic spoons that will sit in a landfill forever, but real spoons.  Silly to point out I know, but this was nice to me.\n\nThis is a family owned business thst makes you feel so welcome.  Stop by and show this great local business some support.

In fact, I rarely eat ice cream anymore but when this opened and I saw it on yelp, I wanted to try it due to the stunning reviews about their taro/ube ice cream. Therefore when I had some friends in town, we took them along and we all tried this new place together! \n\nThe place itself is quite quaint. It's pretty small but the decorations are really cute. However, when we went, there was only one person working soooo it was quite backed up. There was a party of 4-5 that was already there. Then my group was a total of 7 people. So it took a while to be able to try the ice cream and pick. I mean, it's fine, I don't mind but for those that do, keep that little fact in mind before going. \n\nYou're free to sample whichever flavor that you want. I think I tried taro, mango, macapuno (young coconut), and heath bar. In the end, my friend and I decided to share a scoop of taro/ube and heath bar. I also tried some of my friend's cookies and cream. \n\nThe cookies and cream was amazing. One of my favorite ice cream flavors :D so it captured my heart. I rarely ever buy cookies and cream at the grocery stores cause it comes in such a huge tub and I could never finish. Now I know where to get my cookies and cream fix! \n\nThe taro/ube was pretty good. Has a nice flavor to it. I mean, I'm not CRAZY over it but it was decent. \n\nAs for the heath bar, I think I've had better. I think it needs more pieces of heath bar in there. It was really nice when I finally go to a piece of the toffee though!\n\nI didn't really care for the macapuno mainly because I'm not a fan of coconut. I also didn't really care for the mango ... maybe because it tasted like they made it out of the dried mangos you would buy in packages. Haha. \n\nThe prices are pretty decent from what I've experienced. They also give you HUGE scoops. Also, from what the woman told us, they get their ice cream from San Jose.\n\nSo don't hesitate to give this place a try. Glad to finally see something amazing open on my side of town ;D", "type": "review", "business_id": "iN0HhYwuF5BhGDDqUPKitQ"}

Cronuts - I did not think I would enjoy what is a cross between a donut and a croissant, however, it was tasty and I would eat these over Krispy Kreme which is in the same strip mall.\n\nc.  The Ice Cream - Not sure what or who the manufacturer is, but they do drive the ice cream down from Northern California or have relatives / friends bring it to them.  So this is a real \"import\".  The ice cream was pretty good and I would come back for it. Nothing particularly mind blowing, but very good, creamy and I really love those flavors loaded with all the extra fixins and bits.\n\nd.  The Ambiance - Very eclectic.  Nicely decorated in a homey amateur way.  A few tables to sit, but oddly set up and not enough space.  If / when they get busy, there will not be enough tables for sure.\n\ne.  Get over there - Get on over to this place and try it out. It is fun, it is family, it is a good experience.

If you ask me, the first floor has all the good stuff. In a glass case they have a bunch of different pastries and goodies like chocolate covered rice krispies treats on a stick.\n\nOf course I cant forget to mention that as soon as you enter on the first floor, they give you free chocolate samples ranging from Kisses and Mini Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, to Mini Hershey Dark Chocolate squares.\n\nFrom my first initial visit, this was only the soft opening. The grand opening is on Tuesday, June 3rd 2014. I asked the lady at the register if there were gonna be any grand opening specials. She said she didnt know. That was kind of lame. No buy one, get one or free grab bags with purchase. Nothing.\n\nSo in closing, I recommend you start off on the first floor, get your free sample, and then go straight to the goodies case. Then, if you get bored or are into Jolly Ranchers, go to the second floor. Oh, and if you are into any kind of bling, they have that every where in the form of pillows and shirts.

The bakery items are delish! Although they are not made in the store, all the ones we got were sooo good! My favorite was the peanut butter cookie sandwich. \nI was also excited to see Mauna Loa Kisses, which you can only find in Hawaii and at their store. So of course those came home with us, along with the one pound PB cups and some adorable coffee mugs. \nAs for the price, it wasn't too bad. I really didn't feel that it was all that outrageous considering that it is the Hershey Store on the Las Vegas strip and you are paying for the brand. \nCertainly something to check out if you are at NYNY!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HQuh9sfojI_53_Pm6-9WUw"}

Today was not my first visit. I have noticed continued improvement every visit, which is why I chose to hold off on my review. Today was my 4th visit. \n\nThe Pros: There has been an increase in numbers of their friendly and helpful staff. This increase in numbers has reduced the time waiting on line to a very reasonable time frame. Today, a Saturday morning, I had only one person ahead of me.  The dining room was full. Customers, of all ages, were happily socializing, eating donuts and drinking coffee.  If you buy less than 6 donuts they are put in bags. If you purchase six donuts or more your donuts are boxed. I'm not sure if that's a pro or a con.\n\nI have noticed a big change in what types of donuts are available.  I can see where the owners have made more types of donuts available, as promised, as time has progressed and a good menu has been determined. You could get pretty much anything today even though, again, it was Saturday morning with a full dining room.  There are numerous options available for beverages also. One does not leave this donut shop hungry (unless of course, you choose to eat your donuts at home!!)  Cost of a basic donut at this time is  .89.

The manager also came by to make sure we got some drinks. We got the food which was just fine. We had a Reuben and the Gaelic chicken.

England lost, which did not make a lot of Brits sitting in the bar very happy.  My first visit to Tilted Kilt left me thrilled and disappointed at the same time.  I was thrilled because it is a wonderful sports bar with a great business model.  The servers are probably the friendliest I've encountered in a long time. Paula had no problem spending time with us and that made us feel right at home.  They also offered us a discount simply because we were locals (people who actually live in Vegas)..  We really did enjoy ourselves, that is, until the food came.  It would probably be no surprise to our friends to hear that we chose the fish and chips on the menu.  We've been looking for a good one since our favorite place for this item closed last year.  The fish was a beer-battered cod that the restaurant proudly claims is made with Sam Adams beer.  It is proudly displayed on the menu as a featured item.  We were very disappointed.  It looked great when it arrived in the basket with fries and onion rings on the side but, we quickly lost interest as we dug in.  The breading was quite doughy and flavorless.  it tasted like grease and when I took a fork and pressed into the fish, it oozed oil.  The same for the onion rings and fries.  Greasy as can be.  This tells me the oil was not hot enough when the food was dropped in.  Why can't these kitchens test the the temperature of oil before they dip anything into it?  Why doesn't a good  line cook or chef know that it takes time for a deep fryer to recover heat lost after frying a batch of battered fish?  Maybe it's me.  Maybe I expect too much but, I don't think so.  I grew up on the East Coast having fish and chips every Friday for most of my young life.  While in school, I worked at several restaurants that specialized in making fish and chips .. or a \"fish fry\" as we called them.  I guess I'll just have to keep looking for that elusive fish fry.  As for the Tilted Kilt; it's a fine place to sit and have a beer!", "type": "review", "business_id": "moX-9x1Z76IlcAM3bAu4bg"}

Our party arrived at 4:30pm in order to get a good view of the TVs for Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nThe good: Food. Everything we ordered came out cooked well and tasted fantastic. The beer cheese? AMAZING. Pulled Pork? Fantastic. After ordering fries from the happy hour menu (more on this later), it took about 20 minutes to get them. Our server gave us a second order at no charge. That's really where the \"good\" ends.\n\nThe bad: They didn't have ANY drinks available for happy hour! What kind of bar, new or old, doesn't have drinks available for happy hour?! It's on the menu, but they \"haven't figured out the pricing for it yet.\" So you still pay Strip prices for alcohol. This was a huge disappointment that they hopefully fix very soon.\n\nThe UGLY: After being there for a couple hours (3 periods, plus intermissions and OT), someone decided to change the channel in the middle of the OT period. We waited for about 2 minutes before we bailed on our check and ran down the way to Yard House who had the game on. We did come back to pay our check and watch the second OT period, but they had split up our table and didn't put the game back on the TV we had been watching. Our server apologized, but the only comment we received from management was \"you should've stayed. They got the game back on,\" met with a chuckle. As a Kings fan, during the eventual Cup winning game, I felt this was very rude and a little bit disrespectful.\n\nI won't trust Tilted Kilt LV to air any professional sport in its entirety from here out. I understand it could have been a freak incident, but to cause customers and fans to potentially miss the game winning goal and NOT APOLOGIZING is pathetic. They are lucky we were honest people that came back to pay the check. Get your issues hashed out and put booze on the happy hour menu and MAYBE I'll change my star rating.

My boyfriend ate at one of the California locations and said it was good so we said, \"why not\"\n\nWell, there was a blonde girl at the door with menus and my boyfriend greeted her by saying hello but he was completely ignored by her.  She didnt even look at us as we walked past her into the place.  Uh, hello?  If you're going to be a door hostess, part of your job is to acknowledge the customers that walk in.  Well, I thought that was pretty rude. So minus a star for that. \n\nAnyways, we got seated right away.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful in regards in what to order.  \n\nI got:\nCeltic Poutine Fries (to share among 3 people total)\nBBQ Chicken Wrap\n\nCeltic Poutine Fries:  HH for $5, and I don't think it was worth it at all.  Although the waitress gushed about how they were her favorite, I beg to differ.  It was a small portion and the fries were so soggy at the bottom.  There was cheese on top but the cheese was just melted into huge chunks..so basically it was fries covered in some sort of sauce with huge chunks of cheese that werent even melted onto the fries.  Even the appearance of the dish was not very appealing itself.  Plus, it was super salty.  I'm not sure why but whenever we eat out at non-Asian restaurants, most of our food always comes out super salty :( \n\nBBQ Chicken Wrap:  I actually really liked this wrap!  The wrap was very flavorful and the portion was very filling.  I wasnt able to finish the entire thing.  It came with a side of fries and so I asked for a side of ranch but the waitress did not mention that it would be an extra fifty cents...it's only fifty cents but it would have been polite if she mentioned it before bringing it out..........Didnt even know until she brought the check out.\n\n\nSome other side notes... one thing I did not like about this place is how they placed the restrooms upstairs making it super inconvenient for customers dining downstairs.  I had to go up 2 flights of stairs just to wash my hands... they really should've placed a bathroom on each floor... Another thing is.. I'm not sure if it is just because this is the Vegas location but the food was a bit on the pricey side.  My friend ordered Stella and it was $11. C'mon!  Was the food worth the price? Eh, we could've found somewhere better.  Will we be coming back again?  Prob not in Vegas if the pricing is different from California.  Worth the try?  Sure, why not but they didnt have anything super eye catching on their menu..", "type": "review", "business_id": "moX-9x1Z76IlcAM3bAu4bg"}

Not knowing much about Kitson prior to my visit here, my first thought was that it reminded me of Urban Outfitters. Along the trendy clothing are humorous and crude gifts. The collection is rather random with books discussing male genitalia via children illustration to a bird-flipping gnome in a selection of colors. \n\nThe thing that sets Kitson apart from UO is their celeb-popular apparel lines like Homies (a play on luxury brand Hermes) and their designer collection (they currently offer a couple Kate Spade NY shoes and Rebecca Minkoff purses).  \n\nThere are two brands that are noteworthy: Ciat\u00e9 (London-based company of premier nail lacquers) and Voluspa (luxury candles and home fragrances). Great products. They're difficult to find since they have just a handful of retailers (I've purchased Voluspa at Anthropologie in the past), so this would definitely draw me back.\n\nThat being said, it's not a store that warrants shopping for necessity (unless you're purchasing apparel). The accessories, although entertaining, are more fun than useful. There are several items that act as Las Vegas souvenirs which makes it a wonderful tourist spot. It's definitely a place to visit; you never know what you may find!\n\nP.S. Photography is prohibited. I promise I took these photos during the soft opening and prior to the \"NO PHOTOS\" sign.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DQy_2lnYGBaw8_aEZSMYAw"}

The manager did replace my sandwich with something else but it wasn't until after defending the use of imitation crab and my having to say, \"I am not satisfied\".  \n\nI might give them another try at some point but for now I'm really turned off and disappointed that they feel the need to blatantly lie about ingredients in their food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3uSNX-JIWLgNDDfIpV_DDg"}

I thought this dish was put together well and was my favorite of the plates I tried. The Trout was smoked nicely and wasn't too much smoke. The Pea Cakes reminded me of Falafels but green with fresh peas bursting out and the Tomato Jam wasn't just sweet Tomatoes it had a little Kick to it. They all harmonized nicely together.\n\nThe starter plate of Cauliflower Casserole was for my taste (maybe not yours) was overly generous with cheese and seemed to lack the onion cream that was in the description. For me this plate was too heavy and I think someone just slipped with the cheese that wasn't in the description of this dish. Possibly an opening hiccup.\n\n I need to reveal a full disclosure that I am sensitive about smoked foods and only care for a mild smoke taste that might differ from you.\n\nI tried the Chicken and Biscuit Dumplings. I received a bowl of many nicely made cheesy dumplings in a very smoky dark sauce with 2-maybe 3 ounces of nicely prepared dark meat chicken a few very thin shaves of Local McClendon Carrots, Chunks of Mushrooms and some fresh pea tendrils. I was slightly disappointed for a few reasons. As good as the Biscuit Dumplings were and they were. This dish for me was too much Dumplings and should have been called Biscuit Dumplings with Chicken. I could only eat maybe one and a half and had I think three maybe three more dumplings. In the description of the dish was the mention of McClendon Carrots. I was expecting carrots to have a co-staring role and not to be  just a few shaves for color.  For my taste the sauce was WAY too smoky but might be great to other people who like smoky food. \n\nMy husband tried the Smoked Chicken and Andouile Sausage Gumbo. He said it was good. He eats Authentic Gumbo whenever he is in New Orleans and said the one at Southern Rail was good but thinner than other Gumbos he tried and also more smoky than others he tried but still good to him.\n\n3.5 stars On the right track but a LOT of Smoke a little steam.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ed6ieiNh4Xr3bmnMyuTDdA"}

When the buzz began months ago about Chef Beckett and partners, Katie and Scott Stephens, wanting to bring a southern flair to the area, Peg and I were all in.  That the new place was going to be at the site of a landmark (Beef Eaters Restaurant) with its own history of fine food was a nice touch. This is not Beckett's Table West...the concept is totally different. The fried green tomatoes and dirty rice croquettes were spot on.  The tomato tart and the house smoked trout appetizers were addictive, inventive and wonderfully balanced. A grilled watermelon salad was a light refreshing bite. As you would expect, all things pork were terrific, and Rail's cider brined pork loin was amazing. Ditto the crispy duck leg confit. The BLT salad was very tasty but the other apps were better yet. Making the call to try their gumbo (ya ya style) and BBQ shrimp was mandatory, and they were full of flavor, not obnoxiously hot like some \"Cajun style\" dishes out there have become. I strongly recommend wearing something that will handle butter and sauce well from the shrimp. Limitless napkins are provided...  Staples like mac and cheese, collards, and brioche with apple butter (think Parker House rolls) were very good. Beignets were authentic and pillowy. Even with it being opening night and week, the service (Jerod (hopefully not misspelled too badly) and Sarah were attentive and very helpful. Front of the house was welcoming. With concepts and execution like this, I frankly don't care \"what the fox say!\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "ed6ieiNh4Xr3bmnMyuTDdA"}

Extensive beer selection with some southern favorites, as well as a wine list that should suit anyone. The menu is southern, so if you're looking to go \"light\" you might be better off elsewhere. We had the tomato and bacon tart which was decadent. We also had the gumbo which had perfectly smoky flavor and a not too thick roux. We did not think the three tiny head-on shrimp were worth the $6 supplement, however. Finally, the pork loan was delicious with a smoky, candied flavor and delicious sweet potatoes. Desserts looked wonderful but we couldn't muster another bite. A couple of kinks with service and timing that we can overlook because it has been open less than a week, but overall a wonderful night at a place that is definitely on our rotation from here on!

I understand newly opened jitters. They opened Friday. I called earlier today for reservations for tonight. I was told that I had the choices of 5:45 or 8:30. I chose 5:45.  The place was hardly full when my party of 4 arrived. We were seated at an open table while an empty booth was clearly available. No big deal at this point. As we are sitting there waitning for our server, we noticed that most of the place was empty. We tried to talk about it, but the noise level was so load, that we couldn't hear each other.\nThe server took our drink orders. He brought water, and we ordered appetizers and entrees at the same time. The appetizers arrived and were mediocre at best. We were finishing them when we finally had to flag down a manager to ask about our drinks.\nIt was at least 15 minutes. BTW, our server wasn't seen at all during this time.\nHe finally brought the drinks.\nThe prices seemed very, very high, but we are ok if the food is worth it. Beckett's Table never disappoints, and we are frequent flyers there. I am from Tennessee, and I know Southern food. Wishful thinking.\nThe entrees arrived. Their Wednesday special, fried chicken, was aweful. It was over cooked on the skin and undercooked at the bone. Two of us had ordered that plate. KFC has them beat hands down. We could have enjoyed 6 buckets for what we paid for this bad food. The BLT salad is a joke. The B is listed as bacon. it was more like bits of bacon sprinkled over a large wedge of lettuce. There was some sort of drizzle, also. This was nothing but a $10.00 plate of ho hum. It didn't even look good, much less act as a real salad.\nThere was a resounding, \"no,\" when asked if we wanted dessert. We weren't going to waste another dime in this place. St Francis is right down the street and well worth the visit if you have to eat in this area.\nWill not go back to Southern Rail. Too bad, too. It is very convenient, and we had high hopes of at least a decent eatery in the hood. The light rail is the only tracks I would visit on this stretch of Camelback.\nNot sure who the 5 star people are, but... hmmm.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ed6ieiNh4Xr3bmnMyuTDdA"}

The menu looks a lot like Beckett's table in layout, but with a southern twist.  Warning, the place can get spendy.  You'll order some fried green tomatoes, some mac and cheese and the brioche rolls and then tuck into a cocktail, an entree and dessert and you'll find yourself dropping about 80 bucks.  The interior is very welcoming and bright.  You can't beat the location next to changing hands bookstore.  Warning, do not park next door in the business building next door.  They will tow!  Our table found things a bit over cooked with the only flavor being salt rather than more nuanced smokiness, also the lack of hot sauce was a little disappointing.  I loved the brioche rolls which come in a pool of butter in a cast iron pan, although they are a buck a roll.  The fried green tomatoes are what enticed us in, but we found them on the thin side with a breading that seemed like something premade and dredged, the pimento cheese needed a kick.  Like I said, it's never fair to judge a place this new, but it's great to see something new go into the old Beef Eater's space which was languishing.  The interior bar is (there are two) is great looking and one of them opens into changing hands.

I ordered the Blackened Prime Flatiron.  The steak was good to order, but I felt it lacked anything to constitute calling it blackened - no crust, no extra pepper or spices that I could tell.  The succotash was hardly worth talking about, but then again, I don't ever recall an excellent succotash?\n\nThe other 2 people in my party ordered the Cider Brined Pork Loin and the Chicken & \"Biscuit Dumplings\".

Overall, a real winner. \n\nWatermelon salad - very light and fresh, yummy\n\nGumbo- nice flavor, a little less spicy than I would typically like, but overall a solid dish.

Service staff really catered to the southern hospitality making sure our dinning experience was nothing short of wonderful. \n\nWe started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes which had a delicious spread accompanying. I felt they were fried perfectly - not to heavy on the batter.  I thought the duck was delicious - cooked perfectly served on top of a  delicious risotto  The Chicken and dumplings was given an \"ok\" as the dumplings were very tough, the chicken was flavored nicely, but the sauce/broth was the best part.

I had been excited to visit since I first heard of the Newton project and another Justin Beckett restaurant in Phoenix, as my husband and I love Beckett's Table.  We have two young children, and it's not very often we get a date night out to enjoy a dinner just the two of us.  When the opportunity presented itself yesterday, we were so excited to try out Southern Rail.  Great wine list--featuring one of our all-time favorite wines (The Franc)--great menu...it was idyllic.  \n\nWe decided to start with sharing a gumbo appetizer while we figured out what our actual meal would be.  It arrived quickly, which was nice, but I have never been as disappointed in a dish served to me at a restaurant as I was with that gumbo. I presume Chef Beckett knows what a roux is, but this gumbo was completely lacking a roux as its base.  This gumbo tasted like brown water with some chunks of chicken and sausage thrown into it with a scoop of rice.  My husband grew up in New Orleans, and his Cajun aunt taught me how to make a proper roux and gumbo.  If I order gumbo at a restaurant, I expect it to be better than what I can make at home (which is pretty tasty if I do say so myself) or at the very least to have a decent roux, and to say this gumbo was disappointing doesn't even scratch the surface.  We sent the gumbo back (I have never before sent back a dish), finished our wine, and left.  It wasn't worth even trying anything else on the menu, wasting precious date night time or money!  \n\nI really hope this was just some kind of weird fluke and that the entire menu isn't as completely lackluster as the gumbo, but I won't be back to give it another shot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ed6ieiNh4Xr3bmnMyuTDdA"}

Southern Rail just might be what you are looking for.  We met here with a small group of friends where we posted up at the bar on a Friday evening.  Had the chance to sample some of the cocktails from their drink menu.  My absolute favorite was the Austin Mule.  An updated version of the moscow mule...very refreshing! I also tried the hush puppy.  It was good, but different.  I am a fan of grapefruit and bitter, but this was maybe a little too bitter for my taste.  \n\nBy about 8pm we were hungry.  At that time, the restaurant was still busy, so we were seated at an extended bar.  Our waiter was great.  Very informative regarding the menu and the wine list.  He helped us choose an amazing bottle of wine.  \n\nOur group decided to sample a few things from the menu and share.  So while this list will look like we ordered the entire menu, we didn't (this time).  Our selections were...Cornbread muffins, fried green tomatoes, succotash, broccoli/cauliflower/leek/rice casserole, the gumbo, and the cider brined pork loin.  My favorites were the succotash and the cider brined pork loin.  I know that some people on here have mentioned it being over done, but ours was cooked perfectly.  Very tender and juicy.  And the collard greens and brown butter sweet potatoes that came with the pork were AWESOME.  \n\nI know that some people have had a fit over the gumbo not having a proper roux.  I get it.  But seeing that I have lived in the south, I wouldn't consider this place as authentic southern food. It is southern food with some changes and interpretations.  If I expect authentic fried green tomatoes, I need to go and talk to my Mother In Law in Tennessee.  This is great southern food, but it has an upscale twist.  So just have an open mind if you do decide to go here.  \n\nWorth trying!  Just come early or be prepared to wait during dinner hours.

The dish was good, but needed a splash of red pepper flake on top. I went with the broccoli, cauliflower, leek casserole entree that was topped with candied pecans. Overall, it was pretty good.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the coconut cake with coconut pudding. It's not a thick pudding more like a pudding glaze that accompanies the cake. The cake was moist, light and not at all sugary.\n\nThere are a few things that I would like to mention. Rochelle, our waitress was friendly and welcoming. When I finished the mac & cheese sampler I sat the empty bowl at the corner of the table. Several waiters walked by without picking it up. When I was done with the dessert plate I did the same thing and again it was ignored. I've been to several restaurants in the area (Central Ave) and it feels like a team effort.

This restaurant is fantastic! To each his own. My guess is some folks might not know food or understand the restaurant's concept. If you are looking for traditional Southern food this might not work for you since it is a fusion, modern type of fare. \n\nLet's start with the decor. Very low key, rustic type of warehouse. It was not part of the original structure, as others incorrectly mentioned, but an add on. I asked and was told it was constructed new not redesigned. The feel of the original building, which is now Changing Hands Bookstore and First Draft Bar, were taken into account. The restaurant has very pretty chandeliers and low key ceiling art. My guess is they were trying to replicate a rail dining cart with big windows, lots of light, and that huge clock on the wall that reminds me of a rail station clock. The bar is to the east and the tables are all just lined up to the west. Very simple elegance and grace. The only thing I noticed missing, and even suggested, is that they need an \"architectual\" type of pineapple sign or wall hanging at the door since they did not incorporate one into any of the wall designs. This is steeped in southern tradition as a welcome.\n\nNow on to the \"loud\" comments. I never even noticed the \"Too Loud\" thing and I am very sensitive to loud noises. After reading the reviews we did notice it was loud. However, we loved it. We enjoyed seeing the joy and celebration on the other patron's faces. The community table was having a blast! We felt that It was not shockingly loud but yes I suppose it is a fun place being part of a bar and all. If we wanted quiet we would go somewhere else. I would never have noticed if my friend did not want to know what the reviewers were saying while we ate. She made me look it up. lol.  I would never dream of taking stars off of a restaurant for something like that since it is the theme of the place. I would just note it as a tip or a comment in the review. At no time could I not hear my friend or servers so it could not have been that loud and the place was packed. ( We got there early and reservations at the \"Rail\" are suggested) \n\nOf course one wants to know about the food. It's totally fantastic. With one of the top noted chef's in AZ how could it not be. Now it is different so be forewarned.  Open you mind to the notion. I know a challenge for most Arizonians. lol. I got the Meatloaf Special. It came with these bread pudding sticks. My guess is these are the chef's version of Southern Hush Puppies. I asked the waitress but she did not know what Hush Puppies were. That kind of shocked me. lol --Even Ms. Nyer here knows what a Hush Puppy is. Two stars off for that. (Insert sarcasm marks here)  These Bread pudding Hush Puppies, which I will call BPHP from now on, were divine! Also, my Meatloaf was out of this world. My friend had the Chicken and Dumplings. She was expecting chicken and dumplings on a plate and not the broth based type of dish she got. She could not stop raving about it. I tried it. Okay, twice but \"Shhhhhhh\" don't tell. It was mouth watering. The Dumplings were so crazy good. Since it was my birthday we had to have desert. My friend got the Bread Pudding and I got the Beignets. We shared. We thought we would take home  leftovers. Nope. The Bread Pudding here is sinful and the donuts are huge. Actually, one of the donuts made it home for next day breakfast but the Bread Pudding was a goner. I have to say Piggy noises could be heard while the pudding was being inhaled. Okay, Pigs are southern, right? ;) I could come here every day just for the dessert. I heard the Coconut cake here is to die for too and I love Coconut cake. \n\nSome people mentioned that service needs to be fine tuned. Well, they must have fixed that up real quick because our service was great. Despite being very busy and a popular place the service was wonderful. I was even walked to the bathroom by a manager. Many folks were walking the floor and stopped by to greet us. Our server was delightful, well in all ways except for the not knowing what a Hush Puppy was. Okay, I have to let that go.  I am kidding of course, for those who do not know me. But really? She does not know what a Hush Puppy is and works in a Southern themed establishment. Again, kidding, our server was really great. Teacher here taught her something new so I am happy. I wish I knew her name. I want to send her a hug and a Hush Puppy T- Shirt. Hahahaha! I love you pretty, wonderful, smiley blonde server, unknown name, friend.  \n\nSo, all in all my birthday dinner was great! They open in August for lunches too. I'm so there. I predict every weekend since school will have started. Parking is fine despite other review. I have never had a problem. There are lots and street parking surrounding The Newton. There's also a huge Light Rail lot right across the street. Darn it! You might have to walk a NY quarter block. \n\nEnjoy Beckett's Southern Hospitality.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ed6ieiNh4Xr3bmnMyuTDdA"}

Had dinner with a friend last night and we did all the recommended dishes:  fried green tomatoes, watermelon salad, and the duck and coconut cake for dessert.  I thought all the food was pretty good.  I was a little disappointed about not being able to taste/find the sausage that was in the rice that came with the duck--it would have added a nice little spice.  The coconut cake was terrific and a nice ending to the meal.\n\nThe reason for the three are things with a little work could be fixed:\n1. The restaurant is noisy--I think there is a trend that somehow the noise is supposed to be an indicator of coolness--it is a decision that restaurants have to make--it is loud but wasn't intolerable.\n2.  The service was just off--sometimes very attentive and sometimes a desert.  If you are going to suggest splitting a dish that has rice--then by all means bring a spoon out so one doesn't have to transfer the rice from one plate to another grain by grain with a knife and a fork--Obviously we would have asked for a spoon had the waiter not been in the desert mode at the time.\n3.  Again if people are splitting plates--have the good sense to bring out clean small plates between courses--they were not offered and we could not ask because again we were in the waiter desert at the moment we needed them.  \n4.  In my mind, unless specifically requested, an appetizer and a salad are two different courses and should be served separately so there is time to enjoy them.\n5.  We had a little bit of the pimento spread left over from the tomatoes and asked from some bread.  What we got was something that was spongy and white on the inside and had barely a crust on the outside--I would certainly not call it bread.  A restaurant at this level has no excuse for serving yucky bread--if you are going to serve it should be able to stand on its own as well as being a complement to whatever it is going with.  A great tasty rye would have been wonderful for the left over pimento or even a robust baguette, but certainly not what we got. \n\nSouthern Rail--I really want you to get to your act together --you are such a welcome addition to the neighborhood--It won't take much--but you have to start paying attention to the details.  Our little corner of the world is pretty competitive--I can just as easily walk east or west as walk south--Please step up your game so I want to head south on a regular basis.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ed6ieiNh4Xr3bmnMyuTDdA"}

Madison isn't exactly a hotbed for incredible Asian-themed foods, so I've sometimes graded on a curve. Or, the craving for good Asian food was so overwhelming that I was willing to overlook a less than perfect visit and rate it a little higher...\n\nHowever, Monsoon Siam deserves every one of these five stars - no curve, no exaggeration. It is SOLID. Like others who've reviewed this before me, I wish I could do more to rate this place higher. It's truly a 5+ food experience.\n\n+ Clean space; tables placed closely together, but not too close to be uncomfortable\n+ Small, open kitchen - you can see the chefs working on your meal\n+ Mouth-watering aromas from the open kitchen - all of that Thai goodness!\n\n+ What a wonderful staff; so welcoming, so sincere, and working incredibly hard to ensure a great experience. \n+ Menu isn't overwhelming - it focuses on Thai food and that's it. You're not going to pick-up a menu that's a dozen pages long and get lost in it like you will at some other places.\n\n+ Papaya salad with skewered shrimp. WOWGASM. I'm a sucker for papaya salad, but this one blew my mind. Sweet, tangy, spicy - all bundled up and served in a crispy fresh citrusy salad with two of the most perfectly prepared shrimp I've ever experienced. \n\n+ Chicken Ka Pow - rated at 3-stars, they aren't joking around with the spice. The plate was loaded with Thai chiles, which were more than capable of (and happy to) provide the mouth with an uppercut of heat. I love spicy, and this dish delivered. My nose was running with a blissful burn, yet the nuances of the dish weren't lost in the heat - the flavor profiles were completely in-tact. The all-white, super tender chicken; the crunchy red bell pepper; the aromatic and slightly sweet roasted garlic... all there. All balanced. All delicious. \n\n+ Shrimp dish with Napa cabbage, glass noodles, and mushrooms... forgive me for not recalling the name of this dish, but my mind was so full of endorphins, that I'm lucky I didn't walk into a pole on my way out of the place. I was on cloud nine (and ten)... once again, the shrimp were phenomenal. The base sauce was slightly sweet, with a touch of anise undertone. Adding a spritz of fresh lime really made the dish sing. Outstanding.\n\n+ Reasonably priced; appetizer, two entrees, and a Thai iced-tea came to just over $30. I was A-OK with that.\n\nFor a place that just opened a few weeks ago, things seem to be moving very smooth. We had one minor hiccup with the service; a beer was forgotten, but it wasn't a big deal at all. They kept our waters full the entire meal, and I barely noticed the misstep. \n\nForget about any of the other Thai places in town - this place is legit. Real flavor, real spice, great service - it's fantastic. \n\nOh - of quick note: limited bar selection at this point as they are in the process of obtaining their liquor license. There were a few bottled beer selections; not sure about wine.\n\nGo. Or carryout. Or both. Just go!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PjviuTR-xCu7gQp_OkypFw"}

I was tempted to write a review but decided to try it one more time. I ate here again and again, now a total of 4 times in 2 weeks. I feel adequately prepared to say that this place blows me away. I have never eaten Thai cuisine so expertly prepared and beautifully presented.\n\n I harken back to the first time I ate at Lao Laan Xang on Willy St about 18 years ago. The subtle flavors of lemon grass, coconut milk and galanga were amazing and so new to my palate. Southeast Asian food continues to be my favorite but the general quality of  the food seems to have declined in the past few years. No matter where you go the menu looks the same and presentation is an after-thought. My old favorite haunt has become tired and uninspired.\n\nMonsoon Siam is a different animal. The dishes are new and exciting. I have never seen tofu so expertly prepared. Some dishes are bold and bright, like the Spicy Roasted Tofu with Basil or the Panang Curry.  Some dishes are delicate and sexy like the Asparagus Delight with a light flavorful sauce highlighting perfectly cooked asparagus and shrimp and the Rama Tofu which is a gorgeous sight to behold. The tofu is deep fried, placed on a bed of steamed broccoli and topped with crispy fried onions. The dish has a luscious peanut sauce which enhances but does not overpower the tofu. I have sampled the tofu soup, simple yet delicious, as well as the Papaya Salad. The salad was lovely, light and spicy just to the right level for my somewhat timid partner. \n\nTo be fair, I love the Papaya Salad/Chicken dish at LLX  but the presentation is sorely lacking. Monsoon Siam is right across the street from Lao Laan Xang. There is plenty of room for two great Southeast Asian restaurants. I hope LLX will be moved to create some new dishes, throw away the tired menu and spruce up their aging home. They still are very busy and have a loyal following. But the gauntlet has been thrown by newcomer Monsoon Siam. For now I declare the new kid on the block a winner!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PjviuTR-xCu7gQp_OkypFw"}

I guess I just can't get it up to review unless I'm swooning or pissed.\n\nSo, I feel just compelled to review this place, despite the plethora of 5-stars they've received in their short time here. I also have the urge (despite my annoyance at myself) to relate that is likely the most \"authentic\" (cringe) Thai food I've eaten in Madison, despite the prevalence of Lao-Thai-Vietnamese food all over town. The waitstaff made a point of letting us know that it's the only Thai-owned restaurant in the area (with so much Lao food here, which we love, I don't doubt it). It definitely conjures up flavor memories of traveling in Thailand, the same way other places bring back memories of Laos, and that's all I'll say about that...\n\nWe've eaten from Monsoon Siam twice now, once in the restaurant (they must have been just recently opened as we were the only people there) and once getting take-out.\n\nThe food was excellent both times... so far we've had: fried spring rolls, the ka pow crispy squid, massaman curry, the pad thai, pad fresh ginger, drunken noodles, papaya salad (best in town!), \nEverything was fresh, well-presented, and amazing. The fried squid was a standout, with a fairly light fried texture and spicy-sweet coating. If I had any gripes, it would be that take-out is just under the amount needed to really pig out multiple times, but 2 meals provided enough for dinner and lunch for 2 people, so what am I talking about?\n\nThe waitstaff was super nice both times (even when I was just picking up), but more important they were ON IT and damn EFFICIENT. I don't know if they brought any staff up from NC (except for the owner-chef) when they opened this branch, but these people know how to run a restaurant.\n\nWe'll continue to visit our favorite Lao-Thai places (Sala Thai 4eva!) in town but the addition of Monsoon Siam to the roster has taken it up a notch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PjviuTR-xCu7gQp_OkypFw"}

While only open for a couple of months, the restaurant has quickly hit its stride, as the chef (Pooh Wonglaka) operated a Thai restaurant in Charlottesville, VA before moving to Madison.  I'm not Thai, so I can't speak for whether the cuisine is authentic or not, but I can state the plates I tried during my visit were well composed, masterfully marrying the flavors of the fresh ingredients in a healthy, balanced manner.  \n\nOur group of six had a 7PM reservation on a Monday evening.  When we arrived, the restaurant had a handful of patrons.  Within 15 minutes, an influx of Thai speaking diners flooded the restaurant to near capacity.  Despite the crush of customers, our effervescent server (Kitty Ashi, the co-owner of the Charlottesville restaurant), visited our table often, making sure none of us ever went thirsty and clearing dirty plates as our group worked our way through the menu.  While there was some confusion with some drink orders, our group appreciated the option of getting separate checks.  I noticed that Kitty spent the entire night conversing with all the patrons, making sure that they felt right at home during their stay.\n\nThe restaurant is relatively small, with a lot of tables densely packed together.  Despite that, the it was not difficult to converse with my table mates.  The open kitchen allowed us to watch our food being prepared.  The restaurant also gets high marks for cleanliness. \n\nHere are some of the highlights of the evening:\n* The papaya salad and the sun-dried beef appetizers were exceptional.  The papaya salad expertly balanced the slightly tart flavor of the green papaya with the spiciness of red chili, the saltiness of the fish sauce and the bright citrus flavor of the lime juice.  The curing process intensified the beefy richness of the sun-dried beef.   The meat is then deep-fried, but there is enough moisture left in the beef to optimize the interior chewiness - exterior crunchiness quotient. \n\n* The deep-fried tilapia served with garlic chili sauce was another exceptional dish.  Again, the kitchen nailed the texture equation, masterfully balancing the flaky interior with the well-seasoned exterior crust.  Complimenting the fish was a well-composed sauce, perfectly melding the flavors of the garlic and chilies.\n\n* The green curry continued on the theme of balance, masterfully layering the warmth of the curry with the aromatic Thai basil.  It's easily one of the best curries I've had in Madison.\n\n* The delectable drunken noodles (wide rice noodles stir-fried with string beans, bamboo shoots, tomatoes, basil, red peppers, and chili, in a spicy garlic sauce) were also a pleasure to eat.\n\nThings I liked, but not loved:\n* After the papaya salad set the appetizer bar extremely high, the bland vegetable spring rolls were a disappointment.  While well prepared, they didn't offer that same explosion of flavors provided by our other dishes.\n\n* The same can be said about the Crying Tiger entr\u00e9e (Marinated flank steak, pan grilled, sliced, and served with a spicy dipping sauce).  After enjoying the intense Asian flavors of the sun-dried beef, this dish paled in comparison.  Since flank steak is toothsome to start with, it really needed to be thinly sliced to help combat the chewiness of this cut of beef.\n\n* Due to the heat of the June evening we visited Monsoon Siam, the beer taps were not working, leaving us with a very limited beer selection.  In the month since my visit, the restaurant now has a full liquor license and now has a comprehensive list of cocktails and wines to enhance the dining experience.\n\nThese small flaws did little to rain on our dining parade.  If you are looking for well-executed Asian cuisine using fresh ingredients, Monsoon Siam should be near the top of your list.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PjviuTR-xCu7gQp_OkypFw"}

There's a drive thru and you can take your order to go or you can dine in. The prices are reasonable. I ordered an 8 piece meal which came with 8 pieces of chicken 1 large side and four biscuits just under $15. The chicken only is $10.39.  Got the mild flavor for Mr B. I tasted one wing and my thoughts are its okay nothing special. They don't measure up to the ones I get over at Johnny Mac's that's for sure.  I like the skin though it had a nice  crunch a slight garlic taste to it. The biscuits are pretty good.  Buttery. The potatoes with gravy is good. My family likes it. I'm a fan of their sweet tea though!\n\nService wise, everybody is still green. There was a slight confusion with my order. I was given a receipt and the number on cash receipt is different from the number for the chicken order that the cashier never handed to me. So I waited there for a while because number I had wasn't being called until they figured  out 5 minutes later.  \n\nParking lot is really small. On the drive thru side there's only one way to get out. It could be a pain in the butt trying to get out of there when it's really busy.\n\nFor the price value of the meals and for the convenience it's great for families.\n\nNote: Lobby closes  and stops taking orders at 10pm but you can still get fried chicken till 11pm when you take your car through the drive-thru window.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kD6XekbKju5vqIoTEYB08Q"}

Between the foreign language that money people speak, the crazy amount of paperwork required and the hard to understand list of fees and charges, when seeking a home mortgage I used to resign to being taken advantage of in some manner.  I've had no fewer than six mortgages over the past 15 years with each one of them leaving me with very little sense of satisfaction other than the loan itself.  \n\nI came to Jeremy and his Prime Lending Team after walking through the loan process with one of those online lending companies that advertise low-cost and easy processing and delivered neither.  My initial impression was favorable but even the online guys said all the right things initially.  My second impression was more important and I liked Prime Lending's hands-on approach to the loan process.  It felt a lot more like I was dealing with people who were not only on the same page but I was actually a member of the team instead of the least important part of the equation.   The communication between the Prime Lending team and the client is so good it actually feels like yours is the only loan their working on.  Not one time did I ever have to ask about our loan status.  Not once did I ever have to wonder what we were reading or signing.  They do an amazing job of organizing, communicating and educating.  Most companies I've dealt with do a decent job of organizing, a fair to poor job of communicating and a horrible job of educating.  \n\nLet's face it, the loan process, is not easy.  And I'm not suggesting  that it take the place of golf or vacationing.   In today's money world, you will still work very hard providing, documenting and justifying your worthiness. It will be taxing and frustrating and demanding and satisfying - often all in the same day.  Jeremy's team at Prime Lending didn't invent the mortgage.  They just apply, and apply so well, the things that are grossly absent from the process in my opinion.  They involve you in the daily, sometimes hourly progress of your loan.  They are incredibly informed and organized and work tirelessly to make sure you stay organized too - even if you are not prone to doing so.  \n\nJeremy assigns a loan officer assistant type person to your file (ours was Tonia).  Tonia's job is to make sure when your file goes to underwriting it is so complete there are no requests for additional documentation like a note from your mother or DNA analysis.  To be frank, I thought Tonia was a bit of a pain in the *ss at first.  Then you realize her goal is to be so thorough and even invasive that the underwriting part is reduced to a formality.  I have no doubt that is what happened in my case and that it was the best approach.  I always felt like in previous loans when files went to underwriting and I was asked for additional docs the loan processors weren't educated or didn't care enough to know what was needed to make the loan to begin with.  Tonia has a most difficult job as she has to ask the difficult questions. She has to impose and investigate and pry.  She was professional, knowledgeable and incredibly thorough.  I didn't fully appreciate the job she had done until we went to underwriting.  \n\nI could not be more satisfied with Jeremy and Tonia and the Prime Lending HOUSE team.  All you could ever ask of your loan people is for them to be competent, honest, make the process as painless as possible and that they minimize unforeseen obstacles, understand timelines and share information with you along the way.  They have done that for us.  They have exceeded our expectations and I will openly recommend them to anyone willing to listen.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XkEQbX22FSkNC1GQrM2tmQ"}

You see, with her grandiose expectations of this barbeque chain to be on par of her regular dining experiences along the upper echeleons of Scottsdale or Paradise Valley; I had to see this to believe it.  \n\nAnd believe this.\n\nYou see, I expected this half-wit bourgie (slang for bourgeouis) to step out of her stretched navigator upon arrival of red carpet and camera flashes.  This place may have been too trite; but understand, I was just a lowly traveler following the drove of Avondalians, Goodyearians, Litchfielder's and heaven forbid...even Tollesoners who made up the greater of South-westerners  who were obviously deprived of Barbeque.  Heck, the lines has been out the door since their opening.  And for good reason!\n\nBut not in the eyes of Ms. Melody C.   You see, waiting in line to pay for your own food and than, gasp...be seated next to nice families, old people, maybe families with old people and children or even children themselves with no families; I don't know...but you do have a choice of sitting on a picnic bench that line the sit-downs across.  Melody C. failed to see that there are also individual little mini-benches for Snobs who care not to sit next to normal people.  And why should people like her sit next to people like you and me, folks?  I mean, there is a huge difference and according to Melody C....it's because we don't adorn our homes with just pictures of ourselves with our faces smashed next to a similar looking drunk Snottsdale bourgie while what appears to be flashing a gang symbol.  Alas, it is not folks...be relieved as it is just the hand symbols that represent her greek letter organization.  \n\nI expected her to walk past the red carpet, wait in the non-vip line as with everyone else and gently setting her purse down and saying \"Ewww\" as she notices a guy in a cardinal's jersey stand near her $2,500 prada bag and saying \"YOU'RE STEPPING ON MY PRADA BAG! It's worth more than your paycheck! Get the ___ off!\"  \n\nYep.  \n\nFood - excellent.  Price, great!  It's barbeque and long overdue for South West valley.  Everything is alacarte but not as expensive - line wraps around metal iced troughs with all sorts of bottled soda, beers and delights!  Nice.  Once you get to the counter with 6 people screaming \"next!\"  to registers - order your alacartes; they place everything in black plastic bread trays where they slide your non-bourgie card and send you off to the abyss where there is a pickle and pepperonchini, and raw onion bar.  Nice.  Paper towels, plastic utensils, and even rows of butcher paper so that you could go sit next to someone like myself, and some kids, and old people and even Melody C. who is grumbling to herself and can't believe she just spent the lint and pocket change for food only to wait in line and sit on a picnic bench. \n\nBy the way.  Did I mention that there are two barbeque sauces on each end of the picnic tables - not the best bbq food I've eaten, but it's dang good and the creamed corn is absolutely delicious.  Family had the jalapeno smoked sausage, BBQ ribs, some loaded potato, pudding, a ginormous rice krispie treat, etc.  Awesomeness.  I went on the Friday before Father's day - I loved it.  Down to earth and awesome.  And the staff there sometimes has hats that are cabella camouflage/duck dynastish and others don't....I think it's a rank system to be wearing that hat and some don't.  I'll figure it out later as soon as I'm done digesting.  A little over $34.00 for family of four....a la carte.

We chose brisket, pulled pork, baby back ribs, cole slaw and baked beans.  The smell in the car was wonderful, and we couldn't wait to dig into the bag.

Hubby went for the original, and he really didn't seem to enjoy it too much.\n\nThe only thing I found redeeming was the pulled pork, so that's what I ended up eating.

However, the baked beans weren't what I was expecting.  In my mind, they're usually somewhat sweet and flavorful.  These were bland and reminded me of bad refried beans.  When we were tasting them, my hubby made a comment about putting them in a burritto, because they looked like some we've seen in Mexican restaurants.\n\nOn the good side, we have plenty of white bread to last us through the weekend...they serve it with the BBQ.\n\nI'm sad to say, we were highly disappointed.  Will we try it again?  Probably not.  And, that's too bad, because there aren't really any BBQ places in our area.  I guess we're destined to long drives for the kind of BBQ we enjoy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "47xaD3fBnj_cLJbRgHmKfg"}

The brisket was tender but a bit on the dry side, however,  a little tomatillo sauce  took care of that problem.   What I noticed most about the brisket is the overwhelming taste of cracked pepper.   The taste of the cracked pepper dominated the flavor of the meat. It was just to much cracked pepper for my liking.

This place doesn't pull it off. \n\nWe were lucky enough to not really have to wait long but we were still annoyed even after a couple of minutes. The counter server was very nice and asked if this was our first time and offered a couple of samples. The turkey sample was outstanding but the the moist brisket was tasteless and almost all fat. The ordering process, I imagine, would take a couple of trips to get used to offering no combos, just meat by the pound (or half-pound), sausages, and sandwiches.  They give you your food in a drink crate on heavy brown paper. Everything after that is self-service, self-serve drinks, self-serve utensils, and a sign that says \"Your mother doesn't work here so clean up your mess\". The only redeeming quality was they didn't even offer a tip location on the receipt. \n\nI ordered the turkey sandwich which is just turkey and bun and a half jalapeno sausage, my GF ordered the half-chicken which turned out to be pretty good but not great. Again, the turkey meat was really flavorful with a nice pepper edge and the jalapeno sausage was pretty good but again, not great. We ordered sides of creamed corn and green-chili stew. Both had good flavor but the corn kernels were undercooked and chewy. They offer Bar-B-Q Sause (their spelling, not mine) at the table. The sissy sauce is vinegar based and kind of bland and the regular sauce is the sissy sauce with lots and lots of cracked black pepper.  I admit sauces are infinitely subjective and someone may like one over the other but I thought both were ordinary.\n\nRudy's is a corporate chain store trying to recreate a family-style barbecue place and it shows. If I could, I would give a 2.5 star rating for the food but the average food quality doesn't balance the excessively informal atmosphere. Honey Bear's in central Phoenix or on Van Buren is an authentic family-style barbecue place and one doesn't mind the wait or serving yourself because the food is unbelievably good. In fact I know the more I self-serve at a place like Honey Bear's the less overhead they have to pay and are more likely to stay in business. Dillon's has excellent food as well and I would go out of my way for a sit-down meal but will probably not be going back to Rudy's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "47xaD3fBnj_cLJbRgHmKfg"}

I had the moist brisket, creamed corn and potato salad.  The brisket had a nice, smoked flavor, was tender and somewhat juicy.  It had a good bark on it, too.  I tried a taste of their two BBQ sauces and didn't really care for them.  That's just me, though, because I like mine a sweet, Tennessee style sauce.  Ultimately, the meat should stand alone without the help of sauce.  No sauce was needed.  The creamed corn was really good -- sweet and yummy.  It really complimented the savory flavor of the meat.  The potato salad...not so much.  It's completely commercial tasting.  I didn't realize it until my hubby sat it down and saw it's shipped in from New Braunfels, TX (very close to the BBQ capital of Lockhart).  I will skip that one next time.  They do not have a kids menu, which was disappointing but not a deal breaker.  We did fine with the offerings.  They had turkey, which was very good.  Moist, tender and well seasoned -- they ate it up.  My older son had the corn on the cob -- devoured -- and my youngest had the baked potato (made my own mashed with some butter).  The potato is expensive, but nice sized, that comes topped with butter sour cream and shredded cheese.  My hubby had the brisket, corn and sausage.  He said the sausage was good and flavorful.\nLine was out the door and waited about 30 mins.  Love the picnic style seating (real BBQ style) with all your drinks, eating utensils, etc serve yourself.  We will be back again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "47xaD3fBnj_cLJbRgHmKfg"}

The BBQ sauce you add yourself at the table, which the spouts were clogged.  \nNow I really thought that they would have some good potato salad and coleslaw being a BBQ place. I was very wrong.

I have actually had better frozen store bought. \nI hate to do a bad review but really if the food was better I'd totally give it a great review.

She suggested the Maui, which was a blended drink with mango, guava...and I don't remember. She said it was good, so I was ok! She asked if I wanted the mango nunu in it as well, and I was like sure! The total came out to be $5ish dollars...for the 20 oz Smooch size, which I did not even know I ordered that size! My thinking is that it was very loud and she probably threw the smooch word in there somewhere and I said sure!\n\nSo I ended up with a large smoothie for myself.

The fries were French style, which is closer to the typical ones you will find in Mediterranean Sea, flavour-wise normal.\n\nFor a Portuguese restaurant it would make sense to have a bit better quality olives, but maybe I had high expectations!\n\nI would give it 3.5 stars but since there is no such option I'll go for three - space for improvement!!!\n\nI will certainly go back to try more!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ORI4Yt7lQf18z3x1Rih-Tg"}

Despite the place being mostly empty, we ended up waiting for our food for approx 15-20 minutes. My hubby got the chicken club poutine, which was excellent. I got the regular burger, which was bland as cardboard. There was absolutely no spicing, and even with added toppings, the burger was devoid of taste. The pop machine had lots of selection, which was exciting, but it was hard to use. My fries were good. I decided I'd like to return to try the poutine myself, although I didn't want another burger.\n\nSecond visit: Just came back from my second visit and it was incredibly disappointing. I went with 3 co-workers. 3 of us ordered poutines and 1 ordered a salad and burger. I ordered first, so when my buzzer went, I was surprised to see it was my co-worker's order. We switched buzzers and I expected my order to be next. 10 minutes later, all of my co-workers had their food and Union Burger had completely forgotten about mine. I went up and (after waiting a good 3 minutes for someone to notice me waiting) asked about my food, and they were oblivious. I mentioned my co-workers would all be done eating while I was still waiting for my food. They asked me to sit down and wait, after first asking me 3 times if I was waiting for the Buffalo Chicken poutine (to which I answered back, 3 times, \"No, I'm still waiting for the Chicken Club poutine). 5 minutes later, they gave me my order in a \"to-go\" bag, figuring, I guess, that I wouldn't want to sit and eat even though I'd originally asked for my meal for here. \n\nWhat was even more disappointing is that after I FINALLY received my food, I didn't even get so much as a \"Sorry about the mix up\" apology. I asked if they had comment cards. In response, they gave me a free burger card... which is only apparently valid on Wednesdays. \n\nI don't want a free burger - I want to voice my disappointment at the bad service. And if I did want something from them, it'd be either my money back, or a free poutine since that is what I went in to get.

My friend said the food was actually really good here, and this is a friend with exceptionally good taste. Whatever, bar food + good people, sign me the effe up.\n\nHooligans is a brand new bar tucked in the corner of the complex. Once inside the the bar was lit blue and has black & white collages of old school Vegas. It's a locals spot, for sure; or a place off the strip, you can come for a drink and one of the best burgers you'll find in Vegas. \n\nThe bar is the center piece and has quarter poker machines. They have players cards here, y'all, so rack up points. My friends gambled all night and their bar tab was null at the end of the night. Also, the bartenders here were beautiful. Hi Nicole and Sky. \n\nAnyway, on to the truly important thing... This burger! I ordered the Jalape\u00f1o Popper Burger. Sweet mother of Pete and all damn things holy; this was one of the best burgers I've ever encountered. 2/3 lb of grass-feed beef, lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, cooked to medium, topped with cheddar cheese, fresh jalape\u00f1o peppers, freshly cut, and tempura-ed (is that a word?), with a bun that's grilled so it's nice and crunchy toasty... I love you, JPB. I got it prepared medium. It came with fries a la in-n-out: freshly cooked and fried. This is the KEY here, all food is cooked freshly. My burger took a little longer to get, but it was worth the wait. This bad boy only cost $11.00 too. It was so big, I got to enjoy it at home a second time. The chef here is the same guy that lent his talents to Bruddahs. You can taste the love in the food and it is of such great quality. I feel like I hit the jackpot Saturday.\n\nHooligans also has TVs for sports games, pool tables, ample space, hi-top tables, attentive staff, a vending machine with snacks and smokes, reasonable prices, a chill, local vibe, rewards system, and amazingly fresh food!! Definitely a fan. Can't wait to go back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "6_3QPRIym6QXqW4DTVvXmg"}

It's on my way home from work so it's a cool place to stop for a drink and try and win some money. The vibe of the place is cool and they're still pretty new so they're working out the kinks. It's kind of an old Vegas lounge with a modern feel. The only crappy thing is that they're hidden from view so it isn't easy to find. Just look for Wienerschnitzel, they're behind them tucked away in the corner. They're doing a $50 match play promo right now if you feel like trying your luck.  Don't expect to watch any baseball here. They don't have the MLB package, much to my dismay. Luckily, I work at a Yankees bar and also have the MLB.TV subscription. \n\nBoth times I've been here so far, I've been helped by the bartender, Jessica, and she's great. Attentive, fun to talk to and she surprises you with some fun shots here and there. Update that Sky is also pretty cool and friendly. \n\nI also met Bruce, the gentleman that runs the kitchen. He's great and you can tell he cares about his product. Everything is prepared fresh and made with care. Apparently he was the executive chef at Braddah's before they screwed him over. So he set up this kitchen and he's killing it. I tried a stuffed burger with baked potato fries and it was phenomenal. For $12, you get a gigantic 2/3 pound burger freshly made and stuffed how you want it on a really good roll with these incredible fries on the side. Worth it! I wish they were open a little earlier so I could grab some food on the way home but they're still new and getting set up so I understand. They open around 10/11, if I remember correctly. They also do a happy meal at a certain time which is like a beer, a burger and fries for $5.99 I believe. Something like 1-3pm. I'll double check and edit this.  \n\nAnyway, as a local bartender, I find this place to be a great local bar to support. Screw PT's and Dottie's, support the local independent bars or you'll be left with cold, cookie cutter corporate bars that don't know how to treat their customers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6_3QPRIym6QXqW4DTVvXmg"}

When I arrived at check in, they informed me I was able to stay in the newly remodeled DELANO Las Vegas rooms.  I was super excited. Although it was a $30 upgrade, I had to do it!  \n\nDownstairs is covered in fake walls at the moment as they are doing construction while THEhotel remains open for business. The cafe is closed, lobby shop is closed so you have to venture off to Mandalay Bay for everything basically. \n\nAs I ventured up to my room the hallways haven't changed too much.  New carpeting and some fresh paint, so far.... Not too impressed.  Room keys are modern, like Aria.... Just put the key up to the door and it unlocks. So simple.  As you walk into the room, that's when you notice DELANO.  The rooms are very white, so white you are afraid to sit or use anything. The entry-way bathroom got a mini facelift with new wallpaper, that's pretty much it. The living room on the other hand has earthy-toned carpeting, modern desk with an ergonomic chair, a couch that didn't look to comfy and a leather chair with mini side table.  The mini bar didn't change at all, same marble same paint..... Same with the bathroom. With the exception of the fancy bath amenities (So fancy that a regular bottle of this stuff in NYC is like $30!) NOTHING is different in the bathrooms. The bedroom was stark white with a beautiful leather headboard.  The beds were comfy, but I don't think they really replaced the beds either.  It's a shame, because although the beds are not horrible, they could have replaced them with a more luxurious bed (Wynn/Aria). The pillows were brand new however.... I know this because they were so overstuffed that they were like rocks. When I had mentioned this upon check-out the front desk agent said they were aware of this problem because people had already complained about this issue.  Not the best first impression.  They should make sure that everything is 100%, especially if they are going to make these rooms available 3 months before launching DELANO.  \n\nOverall, I loved the modern South Beach feel of the rooms.  I think they could have done a little more to the bathroom to differentiate itself from THEhotel though. These rooms are still some of the best in town and I can't wait till I can experience DELANO, when it's completed in September.\n\nI am giving DELANO Las Vegas 4 stars because of the issues I had with the pillows, and the fact I couldn't sleep until 2am because MIX upstairs was blasting their music.  I was on the 33rd floor right below the restaurant.  I would try and get a room on a lower floor, on the opposite side of MIX, if you want to go to bed before 2am!", "type": "review", "business_id": "xPhFANaaxGpUZJTP-Lnyhw"}

Don't even think about asking for the panorama suite. There is absolutes NO storage. One tiny closet that wouldn't even let a man's shirt hang freely without hitting the top of the safe. The soap smells like you just washed yourself in perfume. Guest services is not good. Had a broken clock and they came up 3 times to FIX it rather than replace it. Fourth time they replaced it and guess what - it worked. That was also three days after we arrived. When we checked out there were charges from the mini bar which we never even opened. When we checked in they asked us if we wanted a key to mini bar and we said no. Upon checkout when we had the charge for the mini bar the girl said that we didn't need a key to open it. Confusing. We had also requested a refrigerator when the reservation was made. No fridge in the room until we called about three times for it. They don't know what they're doing. Then to put the icing on the cake, the morning we checked out (4:00 a.m.), the computer was down so couldn't remove the mini bar charges and the valet couldn't find our car. It took 25 minutes to finally find the car, which the parked on the Mandalay Bay side valet for some unknown reason. Almost missed our flight home. Won't be staying at the Delano ever again.

All we got was a \"we don't give a crap\" attitude and we had to wait until they were ready to give us a room.  An older lady was sitting in one of two chairs available in the lobby and a worker had the gall to tell the lady and her companion they had to stand up because they were moving the chairs out.  Over the course of our stay we were in 4 rooms, they tried to charge us $100 for damage to the room.  We had been in that room about 8 hours and nobody but us had been in there, but they still tried to charge us.   We were greeted by apathetic staff member after apathetic staff.  The jack hammering and other noise was horrendous, in our 4th room we could hear construction in the room above us, but by then we were tired of being nomadic guests.

It's located on industrial by the Can Can room and some adult stores.\n\nI was a little skeptical with the idea as a picture of the menu reminded me of SkinnyFats so I thought it was like a knock off, but I actually had a good experience.\n\nYou order at the register and there's about 3 or four booths and a couple of tables so the place is pretty small. They have paper menus by the register and their menus also hang off of the ceiling. \n\nThey have burgers, wings, fries, wraps, and salads.\n\nWe had a nice young gentlemen who took our order, brought out our food, and cleaned up after us. It was nice that he checked on us a few times. With this type of ordering system they have you usually just get your food dropped off and that's it.\n\nI got the thanksgiving burger with sweet potato fries, a 4 piece fingers with fries, and a 6 piece wings with fries. This was for three people. \n\nMy burger was really good! The patty was seasoned well, was juicy, and some tasty herbs. It had Sage mayo, cranberry, and stuffing. The sweet potato fries were good and the serving was just right. My only criticism of this is they should totally butter the bun and toast it slightly & they should put more mayo. I know that's fat but it would really make a difference.\n\nThe regular fries were also delicious & their fingers were on point. Nicely seasoned, juicy still, & a good portion.\n\nI always consider food cost and what I'm getting so I felt good about the meal after we all left.\n\nAfter I left I didn't feel like they tried to rip SkinnyFats anymore. I think their focus may be more on the chicken items hence their name. \n\nAll in all I'd go back for sure to try some other things. It was clean, the staff was nice, it's affordable, and they have a lot of unique things.\n\nThe staff should definitely put out a better tip jar. Just saying. The paper cup isn't cute.

What an awkward location! They have stripper stores and a strip club as their neighbors. This place definitely has a rough exterior but the inside is quite different. It's much nicer and cleaner inside. This place opened just 3 weeks ago!!\n\nI do get a \"Skinny Fats\" vibe from this place. The ambiance, the menu, and the name of the restaurant scream SKINNY FATS! \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nSkinny Chick's menu is a little bit more condensed than Skinny Fats though and they do focus around the chicken idea. They do have steak and turkey as well but mostly chicken is the main attraction.\n\nI opt for the Turkeygiving burger, AKA Thanksgiving heaven in your mouth. It's a turkey burger with cranberry sauce, turkey stuffing, sweet potato and mayo. It comes with a side and i got sweet potato tots! yum! The turkey patty was made fresh and did not taste frozen. The stuffing I had a little hard time with the taste. It had a day after taste. It wash't intolerable to eat, I think it still tasted pretty good together BUT it did have that slight after taste of day old stuffing. \n\nI wish they had a special sauce to dip the sweet potato fries and tots in. I love when I can dip them into something sweet like maple cream sauce. \n\nThe table I was in was still really sticky. The container/plate that came out with my burger was also pretty sticky. \n\nWith that being said.. There was only 1 person working the entire place, which isn't a big restaurant nor was it even busy but I felt bad that he was the one taking orders, cooking the food, and waiting on us. Now that's a star employee!", "type": "review", "business_id": "cOPKrTpfmse01coqXiX-CQ"}

They have a bar and a restaurant which is cool, a cold Dos Equis and tacos is always close to perfect.  Along with a perfect location on Valley View in between Sahara and Desert Inn, this place is destined for success. \n\nSo I walk in the bar entrance and was immediately greeted by the owner.  Dude was cool without putting on his \"welcome new customer\" spiel.  He shows me the menu board and explains my options. I decide to get 4 different tacos (pastor, carnitas, chicken and braised beef\") along with rice and beans.  Bottled Coke is an automatic! Garnachas does the line different than El Gordo or Taco Y Taco.... Its more assembly line which allows you to \"build your own\" on top of your taco. Service was fast and friendly.  All of the tacos were hot and moist and had a ton of flavor.  Topped with Jalape\u00f1o salsa, i could've eaten more than the 4 but I showed restraint.  The only thing I would change would be the rice, it was kinda of plain and just hasn't as good as it should be.  The owner thanked me for the comment and said was going to have 2 different kinds of upgraded rice very soon.  \n\n4 tacos, rice and beans and a bottled Coke was $12 bucks.

I original joined this gym (Box) in January 2014 when it was known as Scottsdale Health Care (SHC). \n\nSo, I too was recently on Yelp, looking for the perfect fit.\n\nAs such, I was skeptical of a lot of reviews because of biases or a person's one bad experience. With that said I would like to add my review to help you.\n\nI must warn you though... I'm obsessed with Camelback Crossfit (CBCF); it's like a 2nd home, and I have no intentions of vacating anytime in the near future. I'm going to squat here until I die! The review is most definitely going to be a little biased. I mean what would you expect? That was a rhetorical question. I will however try my best to be as neutral as possible, or a voice of reason so to speak.\n\nAtmosphere:  \nNow you have to understand, at the end of the day, I am an introvert. During the rest of the day it just depends on whether or not I made it to CBCF, or if I am Hangry, or Sleep Deprived, the Vibes (Yep! Said it) around me, and/or alcohol :p.\n\nThis makes interacting with new people in an unknown territory a lot of work! I will also state the fact that I did try out a couple other Crossfit gyms, of which, I had friends at, until I found CBCF.\n\nJustly so, the atmosphere makes this place, like so many have said before. I was content with getting in, doing the work out and leaving. Now I get there early, shoot the shit during, and hate leaving after. I've never had that feeling at any other gym in my life! \n\nIt's just something you have to come and feel for yourself. Feel them vibes!\n\nWOD (Work Out of the Day):\nA different hour long adventure every day! Very rare to do something twice in a month, except for weightlifting, but they differ in set and reps each week.\n\nHere's honest for you... It won't be easy at first, Crossfits a whole different workout, but you'll make it through and be damn proud of it!\n\nThey've also recently added new classes such as Crossfit 101 & 102, Olympic Lifting, and Running Endurance & Mobility. There's whisper of a Yoga class being added too!\n\nPeople:\nDo you know how hard it is to be cordial at 5 in the morning? Would you believe me if I told you I was warmly welcomed at 5am? Do I need to expand more on the people/community of this place?\n\nHow often have you competed against friends who are cheering for you before, during, and after?\n\nPeople who challenge you to get one more rep? Or add 5 more pounds on the bar? Who want to see you grow into the person you dream of being physically and mentally? \n\nAnd as the days and months go on I continue to become friends with more and more old and new members alike here.\n\nCoaches:\nI have had the privilege of being trained by Matt, Dom, and Rob, but will not forget to mention Brady.\n\nAll of whom are constantly improving everyone's form on lifts and movements alike, as well as motivating people to their next plateaus. They truly know what they are talking about and rightfully so given the title Coach.\n\nRemember that atmosphere I was talking about? The coaches here are the driving factor behind it and have earned respect, not asked for it.\n\nYou won't come into this place and be forgotten about!\n\nPrice:\nCan't beat it! At least for a Crossfit Membership. Yes, I do know, I count shit for a living, and it was a big factor when I initially chose CBCF.\n\n$115 for an individual. \n\nDiscounted to $100 for Military (thank you btw) and students. \n\n$200 for 2 family Members.\n\nWhy I chose Camelback Crossfit: See above", "type": "review", "business_id": "3S_OzqFk_H_68pH9vr0w-Q"}

I will come back in a couple of weeks to see how things are going. But first, let me praise the staff to the high heavens. Unlike a lot of new places downtown they don't assume you're going to just drink the koolaid. They were ernest in their desire to make sure we were comfortable and happy with our food. They seemed to have actually tasted most of the food and had good recommendations for us. Much like La Comida, I'd eat here again regardless of what I thought of the food because the staff made the experience worthwhile. Fyi, I don't care for the food at La Comida. \n\nThe food. Well. We split oxtail risotto which, honestly, was so rich as to be offputting. I ate maybe four spoonfuls as did my lunch date. There was plenty left to take home but we passed. We also had the bacon jam with brie. It was actually delish, but again, a little went a long way. A very long way. Again, we passed on taking the extra home. The empanadas were filled with nice chunky meat that was tender though it could've been a tad juicier. The mushroom flatbread was a great appetizer and the pizza cook was lots of fun without being overly familiar.\n\nHere's my issue and it's something you can actually see in the accompanying picture. The risotto and jam seemed to be swimming in something. It wasn't grease. Maybe some oil like truffle? The lake of whatever it was did not inspire one to want to deal with that in a to go box or when it inevitably congealed. Again, offputting is the only word I can find to describe my feelings about it. It really wasn't greasy or slimy, but it looks that way. Combined with the fact that everything (except the empanadas) was just way too rich means I won't be pushing this as a place to go. Not yet. \n\nI'm sure that Carson Kitchen will find it's feet very soon, and hope so. I like the vibe even if the decor looks like someone went to EAT and decided that's the new downtown Vegas hip eatery look. Seriously, it almost looks like a blatant rip off. They seemed to be working on an outside patio which in and of itself will get me back this summer. And, not to be petty, I give it points for being filled with adults, not a bunch of bearded wannabes. \n\nThe pricing seemed a tad ambitious. For small plates you can go from a quick bite to a $50 lunch in no time. Not outrageous but probably not in my, \"let's run by for a nosh\", price range.\n\nI look forward to sampling more of Carson Kitchen soon but I'm hoping they bring the ooze down a notch.

This restaurant by Chef Kerry Simon takes comfort food to the next level!  Started off with a few of the shareable plates. If you don't care about your waist line or your cholesterol levels, start with the crispy chicken skins. They have taken the best part of fried chicken and made it an appetizer!  The Wellington empanadas are amazing!  The beef inside is so flavorful and tender.  Next we had the tempura green beans. The beans were so fresh and the tempura was the perfect crispiness/saltiness. Don't forget to dip in the cream cheese sauce. Next was the veal meatballs with sherry foie gras cream sauce. Again heaven. Taking down home comfort food and jazzing it up a notch. Did I mention we sat at the chefs counter and were able to talk to the entire kitchen staff while they prepared our meal!  It was like being on a cooking show. For our main course, we had the short rib sliders and the baked Mac and cheese. Again amazing comfort food taken to the next level. The short ribs have a root beer glaze that is a perfect compliment to the braised beef. I've been dying to try the Mac and cheese since the day I saw a pic of them on FB a few months ago and it was so worth the wait!  \nAs stuffed as we were, we still tried the Bourbon Fudge Brownie with brown butter bacon ice cream. And we were so happy we did. The ice cream had actual bacon bits in it!  Paired with the decadent chocolate brownie, the saltiness/creaminess of the ice cream was what God must have intended heaven to taste like :)\n\nI will definitely be coming back with lots of my friends in tow!", "type": "review", "business_id": "sih8j621A66QoiUFues5qQ"}

It was busy, but they were able to seat us right away at one of the community counters/tables. Space is at a premium in their close-packed space, so expect communal seating to be a more likely fate than a private table.\n\nThe dish portions and pricing seem to indicate they're more the \"we're not here to engorge you, we're here to delight you with good tasting food\" kind of place. \n\nWe ordered the \"Devil's\" Eggs, Roasted Young Beets, Rabbit Ragu and Duck Confit Flatbread. The \"Devil's\" Eggs were ridiculously delicious. The Roasted Young Beets with goat cheese and orange slices was interesting and good. The Rabbit Ragu wasn't so great. Although alright, I couldn't taste any rabbit flavor over the spiciness of the sauce. And the duck in the Duck Confit Flatbread was tasty.\n\nThe service is top-notch, but also a bit pandering with their, \"You've made some excellent choices.\" I'd like to think that if I ordered ANYTHING from their menu it would be an excellent choice.

We got there at 11:30 and were quickly seated, however, it is a small space and filled up while we were there. They sat us at the communal table, I was fine with it and had some interesting conversations. However, I could see how if someone was shy or didn't enjoy talking to strangers how they might not enjoy sitting there. The decor was industrial modern. \n\nWe split the chicken skins with smoked honey - which was awesome! The skins were crispy and the honey gave it the perfect sweet to contrast the salt. Also, it was one of the more reasonable items on the menu at $6. \n\nWellington Empanadas - they were good but I wouldn't order them again. They were really salty, and to me part of the beauty of the wellington is how well they are cooked -while the phyllo dough likened itself to a wellington the filling was chopped beef and other vegetbales. Thus at $10 not my favorite item. \n\nThe short rib sliders with spicy tator tots - three sliders for $14. A little over priced. The sliders had a sweet flavor to them and a crunch from french fried onion the bun. There was not much sauce on them either. My friend likened them to a marshmallow flavor of a rice krispy treat, while I don't completely agree with her I found it amusing. Again, good but not phenomenal and I think I would try something else. \n\nDuch Confit Flatbread - very good, again sweet like the flatbread was brushed with honey - however, very very small portion. Possibly six inches in length by four inches or so across. Also, the flatbread was not crisp on the bottom, however the flavor was good. $10. \n\nGlad I tried it, loved the chicken skins, but a little pricey for what you receive for my taste but it is a Kerry Simon restaurant. If you go for lunch go early - they fill up fast with the downtown work crowd. If there are only two of you expect to be seated at the communal area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sih8j621A66QoiUFues5qQ"}

The space itself is rather small, with communal/bar seating taking up the majority. Does anyone actually like communal dining? Its a hip concept on paper, but no thanks to being seated across from the group of six dudes making their slow, loud, boozy departure. I take it more space will be opening up in the courtyard and ceiling patio eventually? Here's hoping. The old hotel has some great little nooks and crannies, worthy of becoming a go-to late-night hangout.  \n\nFrom greeting through to bill payment, service was friendly and attentive. Our server (Vicky I think?) offered just the right mix of good cheer without being cloying. The only little hiccup was a lengthy wait for our last dish, maybe ten or so minutes, but we didn't feel neglected and weren't in a rush so no harm done. In general, the atmosphere was festive and inviting. Great energy. \n\nOur dishes were 1. Spuds/Sprouts Hash; 2. Veal Meatballs; 3. Wellington Empanadas; and 4. Chicken Thighs with Chimichurri. The first dish was far and away the least successful of the group, and was actually quite disappointing. In flavor, texture and even color everything was monochromatic. The \"spuds\" weren't fully cooked. The dish was heavy, brown, and muddled. The meatballs came next, and were a revelation. They were tender and moist with a rich, dark outer crust, and the foie/sherry cream sauce was divine; especially the bright notes of sherry, which cuts through and elevates the otherwise heavy combination. Not sure how necessary the 9 stray peas are though. Third came the empanadas, with a gorgeous buttery/flakey crust and moist and tender filling. The accompanying \"gravy\" seemed to be made from a demi-glace, as it was layered with all kinds of delightful \"colors\"; problem was it was face-scrunchingly salty. Rarely is over-salting an issue in restaurants, but this was put-down-your fork salty. Finally came the chicken thighs, which I was overjoyed to see on the menu. Thighs are the best and most tragically ignored part of the bird, and CK knows this and gets it right. Boneless and slightly flattened, they are the perfect combination of moist and juicy meat with cracklingly crunchy skin. Just like God intended. The Chimichurri is a brilliant accompaniment, full of brightness and acidity, but once again it was over-salted. The sauce man needs to take it down a few notches. The chimi wasn't as excessive as the \"gravy\" but it was still distracting. Nevertheless, I loved the thighs. The juicy-crispy combo reminded me of my favorite dish at Raku, \"juicy deep fried chicken\"--so bravo and thanks, CK! \n\nI live down the street and am thrilled to have CK in the neighborhood. I'll be back soon to further explore the menu and enjoy the historic space.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sih8j621A66QoiUFues5qQ"}

I thought that the service was great.  Our server gave us his recommendations, was very attentive, and he even gave us a quick tour.  As for the food, I enjoyed half of what I had.  I ordered their Wellington Empanada as an app and their Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak as an entree.  The empanada was a little too greasy and pricey at $10 for two small pieces.  The steak cost $18 and I thought it was worth it. It was delicious, sliced, and full of flavor. My gf had their Bacon Jam as an app and their Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto.  I got a little taste and thought both were pretty good.  Again, wasn't a fan of the price of their Bacon Jam, but thought that the entree was just about right.  \n\nOverall, don't let my 3 star review fool you.  3 stars from me means that they are just \"A-Ok\".  In other words, I don't see myself rushing back any time soon.  I do recommend other Yelpers to give them a try.\nTIP:  Tip regarding their Check-In...double check your receipt.

It's difficult to paraphrase an explosive experience on a full stomach. Ok I'll start from beginning to end. We got there and parking was difficult, greeter at the door was nice, super packed, 45 minute wait, ordered a beer at the bar, waited in the back courtyard. Now this seems rather unpleasant, but this is where Carson Kitchen 'stepped their game up' and delivered. At the bar they had a Brooklyn Brown Ale that my friends and I enjoy and haven't seen here in the west coast. The court yard in the back was surprisingly serene, reminiscent of times spent in a backyard BBQ with friends. The wait was actually 15 mins which translated to 'freaking awesome' (I like the under-promising and over-delivering). Now, the fifth star was credited to the food and the man behind the magic. Bacon Jam is on point and that is no understatement because I found myself spreading that goodness on everything. No joke. I put it on the Mac n cheese, I put it on the gyro tacos, I put it on the coco steak. Don't get me wrong, all of these dishes lacked nothing and were incredible by themselves, but that bacon jam was like crack for me, and given the means I would've taken it intravenously. I guess one of the chefs came out to check on us and he couldn't have been a more 'cool like dat' kind of guy. Kudos to Eugene the chef, you made that food your bitch and owned it. Not quite sure who the owner is but you get the standing 'O' for nailing the whole ambiance of this place. You seriously got that five star taste without all that pretension of those snotty, over priced, mish-mash, upscale casino restaurants.

At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!\n\nThe dining area was little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique sitting area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.\n\nI'd classify the fare as \"New American\".  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their \"Wellington Empanada\" was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.  \n\nMy wife gasped when she saw they offered \"Crispy Chicken Skins\" and ordered it almost before our server got out the word \"hello\".  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.\n\nWe shared the \"Rabbit Ragu\" and the \"Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak\" done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surpisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.\n\nCan't wait to drink and dine outside next time!", "type": "review", "business_id": "sih8j621A66QoiUFues5qQ"}

Burger and steak were cooked perfectly - medium rare, just the way we like.  (Medium rare meaning red in the middle, you have no idea how hard it is for people to get medium rare right).  Bacon jam was so smokey and slightly sweet - just wish they weren't so chintzy about the brie and bread.  I mean, 5 pieces of bread for all the jam??  Come on, now.   The interior is very industrial-y, raw material-y feeling.  Very unique.\n\nWe were catching Book of Mormon after dinner and let our bartender know.  We sat at the bar as there was no other seating when we arrived.  We let her know when we first sat down and she promised she would get us out of there in time.  We ordered everything up front (including dessert) but ended up waiting and waiting for the bread pudding after the meal.  We told her to cancel it and it ended up showing up right as we were leaving.  At this point we were already late so we each scarfed down a bite and ran out the door.  It also seemed more important to her to flirt with her fellow bartender than see if we needed anything.  We all wanted another round of drinks but could not get her attention.  By the time she noticed, we were done with our meal and it was a little late for another round.  Is it customary for bartenders to take away your glass when you still have at least two drinks left?  I felt like I still had a good amount of beverage left when the bartender tried to take away my glass.  Maybe it was our fault for catching a show after dinner but we thought an hour and a half would be sufficient.  Guess not.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sih8j621A66QoiUFues5qQ"}

Which is important because the door is that easy to miss when you have the sun glaring in your face. The seating did take a bit more than I like especially on a Tuesday at 630 but rather than stay out on carson, we found walked through the restaurant to a door that lead to a surprise serene grassy backyard. It was equipped with wicker chairs and a fire pit. We also saw the stairs that lead to the second floor which is not being used due to the extremely high weather. I predict this will be the place to be in the winter time...beers + fire pit = thats where ill be!!!\nOn to the food...for appetizer we ate the wellington empanadas which smelled amazing as I sliced into those bad boys and we also had oxtail risotto and steak- the best combination and my stomach had no complaints. \nThe staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about the food. Though there were a couple of times they almost took our plates before we could finish getting all the sauce with our empanadas but that was forgivable seeing as it looked like we were done but in reality it was us savoring each bite.\nThe cherry on top of the sundae was actually not ice cream BUT bread pudding made of doughnuts!

Carson Hotel in DTLV!!  Came in on a busy Saturday night with at least 30-minute wait for a table of two.  Luckily, we were able to snag two seats at the bar upstairs which certainly has a better atmosphere than the crammed dining area downstairs.  The rooftop patio has this relaxed and hip ambiance: bistro lighting hanging throughout, awesome music playing in the background and plenty of seating especially for a fairly large group.\n\nCocktails are rather great in this place.  Forgot his name but the Irish bartender made our experience that much better.  He explained what goes in each libation and even provided few unexpected treats throughout the night.  Out of all the drinks I had, I liked Towns End (Slow & Low Whiskey, Fernet Vittone, Amaro del sole, Regan's Orange Bitters No. 6, Angostura bitters) the most as I usually tend to go for dark liquors.  Asked for a Sazerac next since I was already going towards that route, but unfortunately, no Pernod at this joint!  The bartender, however, decided to make me a drink somewhat suggestive of what the Magarian (Aviation Gin, thyme & honey syrup, fresh lemon, Mr. Q. Cumber Soda) would taste like.  Surprisingly, I didn't mind the transition from dark to light as the smokiness greatly complimented the Crispy Chicken Skin and its smoked honey dipping sauce.  Right when you know I've had enough liquor for the night, I was faced with Brewer's Fix (Hophead Vodka, apricot preserves, fresh lemon, simple syrup, Prosecco) which was amazing due to the fact that a.) it's on the house and b.) I like India Pale Ales.  \n\nAs far as their dishes, there are plenty of interesting items to choose from.  For this visit, we opted for their shared plates.  If you were only to get one thing from the menu, make sure it's the Crispy Chicken Skins.  Something about a chicharron-like chip dipped in smoked honey sauce is just sublime!  Another favorite was the Veal Meatballs smothered in sherry foie gras cream sauce.  Yes, sherry foie gras cream sauce... it's truly as good as it sounds!!  Also decided to get the \"Devil's Eggs\" (topped with crispy pancetta and caviar) and Roasted Young Beets (pistachio, orange and goats cheese).  Still have plenty of room?!  End your meal with the Glazed Doughnut Bread Pudding (three rum caramel and vanilla creme anglaise).  It ain't no sticky toffee but it's a great alternative.\n\nOverall, Carson Kitchen definitely lives up to all the buzz!!  Delicious food, impressive concoctions,  great ambiance and superb customer service.  Can't wait to go back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "sih8j621A66QoiUFues5qQ"}

I have to tell you though we went today at lunch and I think we were exceedingly lucky that we walked in and were able to sit at a table. There was one table that was being saved for somebody with reservations and everything else was literally full it is a tiny little spot. But it is fantastic. We started with the Wellington empanadas which was fantastic.  We then ordered the fried green tomato sandwich with crab and the short rib sliders both came with spicy tater tots. The tater tots were not too spicy you could definitely detect some Paprika and they were quite good. The short rib sliders were quite sweet. The menu does say that they are root beer short rib sliders so take note of that because they are sweet. But the slider was fantastic the sweetness was offset by a crispy onion that was put on the slider. If I had one note it would be to put a little bit more crispy onion to offset that sweetness. The fried green tomato sandwich with crab was the star the tomato is very thickly cut and expertly breaded. The breading has a nice spice to it. Overall it was a fantastic meal it's a little pricey for lunch but I think you have to look at what you get and then you understand the $40 price tag for two people at lunch.

The chef made it in the kitchen while we watched.  It was served with some lemon slices and some marinara sauce. I liked it with out the sauce. It was that tasty!  It was not at all greasy and had the perfect amount of flavor. \n\nNext we ordered a creation I like to call the back room pizza. We got a large red sauce (you can choose red or white) pizza with banana peppers, cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, tomato, spinach and topped it with Ricotta cheese.  When the chef delivered it, it looked like a work of art. You could tell he enjoyed making it.  The dough is a perfect balance between thin and thick. We like our pizza well done on the bottom but not overly cooked and Grinders delivered!  The first bite and we knew we had found a great pizza place!  We ate about half and took the rest home for dinner another night. \n\nAll in all, I think this place is a secret that needs to get out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wd3nrdoEpikmGcf4NX0ziA"}

While on the way I tried to call twice to let them know I was running 3 minutes behind but was sent straight to a voicemail both times. I arrived and Was greeted by the receptionist. She told me \"the stylist was still with her previous appointment and it will just be a few moments, have a seat!\" I was ok with that, then the receptionist asked what kind of lashes had I wanted to get today and she showed me a variety of pictures to choose from and I got really excited. After about 10 minutes of waiting the receptionist says \"well we'll need to reschedule when are you able to come in next?\" I was like what do you mean, I don't live close by, I don't want to reschedule, why would I do that? She says \"you showed up late and that's our policy.\" I'm thinking if that's the policy then why didn't you tell me that as soon as I walked in the door? Why did you tell me to have a seat and make me wait all this time? After about an additional 10 minutes of arguing because I really wanted to be seen that day and get my new lashes, I'm thinking we could have been half way done with my eye lashes already. They refused to take me and said if they were to help me that their next appointment would have to wait. Then I thought, you made me wait when I first walked in but they can't wait for me?! I asked to speak with the manager and she wasn't available, I left my name and number and still have not received a call!

They're new, clean, and a decent place to hang out at.  However, what's lacking is a knowledgeable staff and desserts that are worth the price that they have them at.  I had their Coffee Ice Cream, which is literally a small scoop of Blue Bunny Ice Cream.  Tasted good, but not worth the $5.95 price tag.  The biggest disappointment is the overall service.  My gf had a few questions about the items on their menu and the staff couldn't even speak to it.  They even stated that they could Google some of the items on the menu for us.  Really?  Google it??  I don't expect a new business/staff to be experts, but at least have some knowledge of what you're serving.  A few of my friends had orders that either took too long (ie. 20 minutes for boba) or were just wrong (i.e. coffee instead of tea).   \n\nOverall, not a fan, not as good as it gets, but giving them a break with an \"I've Had \nBetter\" only because they're new.

As we walked in, the place was lively. Possibly because it is brand new. Awesome interior, but that's pretty much it. I was disappointed after getting all hyped up about this place. Their menu is quite confusing. Snow slush, snow yogurt slush, and etc. I didn't know how to depict the menu and when I asked, neither did the workers. I decided to get the strawberry snow ice (not my first choice, they didn't have the one I wanted \"that day\"), which to my surprise, wasn't fluffy nor soft. It was just like regular shaved ice texture you get from one of those trucks or stands. I was expecting it to be soft and fluffy like kuma's snow ice since their machines look pretty much the same. It was really big, but that's no problem since it was almost a whopping $10 for it. It also came with a lot of strawberries. For me, it was too much. There were three of us there and we still couldn't finish it. I also got a strawberry smoothie with boba which was okay. The boba was hard, yuck. Not enjoyable. My boyfriend also got an apple pie. It was about $5 for a slice and he didn't finish that either. He said was \"okay\" and \"nothing special.\" If it weren't for the interior and very nice decor, I would probably give it one star.

Not a very good first impression, but we wish you the best and hope you are able to work out the kinks...ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  2 \n\n*one for the comfy seating, one for Jenga!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ScSwwoFcIC0mf1vU-6p8eQ"}

Kinda empty. We weren't rushed but we decided to share a drink since I wasn't really hungry so I didn't want to get stuffed. We got the matcha float. The boss recommended that we add brown sugar to it to add some sweetness. It was like drinking ice green tea brewed from hot tea! It was refreshing. It maybe a bit bland especially if you like your drinks really sweet, but my main complaint is things are always too sweet and this was perfect. The boss was really nice and he does recommend things to you and gives suggestions. The people who were working up front with orders and the cashier seemed to struggle a little. But considering this place is new they were still really nice and provided service. They corrected our order because originally they gave us just an ice matcha tea without the ice cream but it was corrected in no time. We played some jenga. The owner said whoever the first winner of jenga is gets a fruit tart. I won! :D. But because I'm nice I shared it with my BF who lost twice btw ;).\n\nSecond visit, the place was pretty much packed and not as empty as it was the very first time. Once again I just wanted a drink! No matter what set of chairs or tables you pick they're really comfy and there are board games you can all play together! This time I came with my bf and his brother. I got the jasmine iced tea with boba. OMG the jasmine tea was so good!! I can't even tell you that it had the brewed tea taste AND it wasn't extremely sweet either! PERFECT! The boba was a little too chewy for me. I like it a bit softer but the tea itself I can look passed the boba. \n\nBetter yet, the boss remembered us and said hi to us again! \n\nI'll update my review soon as I try their dessert!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ScSwwoFcIC0mf1vU-6p8eQ"}

I am proud to say that we now have a place in the 85281 area code that is doing some serious work with cocktails. I had the figitabout it, made with local whiskey and local figgy pudding bitters and it was delicious - a bit smooth for me but a unique and interesting cocktail with strong local roots. Others had the cocktails off the happy hour menu and thought they were well balanced and delicious - I also had a Rye IPA from Hess brewery, and it was good - only thing, waiter needs to pick up the glass and pour at an angle versus directly into the glass - much larger head of foam than needed and I would like to see chilled glasses, if at all possible. When it is summer in Phoenix we need every bit of coolness we can get - from a drink perspective I would say wine and cocktails rule but a good selection of craft brews.\n\nAs for food from the appetizer menu, the ribs were the favorite of the group - they rocked! We also tried the grilled chicken wings - good but I would brown and then grill them, like they do at La Grande Orange. We also had the scallops on top of the breaded and fried avocado. One person at the table though the scallops were a bit raw for her but I look at scallops like I look at seared tuna - it should just brush the grill and that is it so I thought they were delicious - though a bit more pricey at $13 for two full scallops versus $5 or $6 for most other appetizers at happy hour prices (by the way, happy hour is 3 pm to 6 pm).\n\nThey do offer a brunch but please know that until September, it is only on Saturdays - I find that a bit odd since I'm a Sunday brunch sort of guy but hey, I'll give it a shot in a few weeks. \n\nThe music is old school jazz and 50s and the service is good - I think the chef is still feeling out the food for this location after a decade at house of tricks and the plating definitely has shades of that location. I hope to see more innovation in the cocktails and the waiter noted that he was encouraging the chef to  do seasonal cocktails. I have a feeling that I'll go 5 stars after a few more meals but want to go several times before I give up that final fifth star - this is definitely a place I would go to for an early dinner if seeing a Broadway show at Gammage. All in all, I thought mucho gusto was good but this place has that sort of Brooklyn food ethic that makes for some unique eating for those of us in the land of eternal sun. Go try it out and I look forward to reading your reviews! :-)\n\nNote, I also went back the next night for just \"a\" cocktail and for one of the apps I had not tried - I got the Asian pork belly this time and it was delicious - then my neighbor sends me a text about  getting a drink and I invite him over and then I end up having the shrimp and chorizo app (delicious) and another cocktail and we started to get to know one of their amazing bartenders, Trent, and then one of the wait staff, Tory, recommended some other places for cocktails in Phoenix and David, the amazing waiter and cocktail expert recommended some other drinks and then my neighbors wife comes over as well and we do dinner (had the duck confit, good but hey folks, more food, big guy and all - but it was  tasty), then my other neighbor comes over and we do desert and coffee - so let's just say my expected $20 tab ended up being about a $100 but hey, I had a great time the whole time and learned a lot about vintage cocktails - look forward to sitting on the patio and enjoying the cooler weather - they said they are looking at doing brunch in September when the weather cools down.\n\nOne thing would be fun, if the chef had time to walk out every now and then and to ask the guests how they like the food - at a place like this it is nice to eat the food and then connect with the chef - sort of like going to a film festival and meeting the director - I think that will help drive a connection with the community and bring people back - oh, cocktails, try the purple (or was it blue) daisy and the date night, and if Trent is there, try his pre-prohibition old fashioned with Maker's Mark - delicious!", "type": "review", "business_id": "q1QRFM3Rh8K9jPMWNus6hA"}

I've been following Freak'N Brew for a long time. They were supposed to open a while ago, I think they had a lot if red tape to go through to finally open. \n\nWell my friends and I made the trip to come here this past Saturday night. Finding it can be a little hard. It's in an industrial warehouse complex just west of the 101.  After passing many buildings I saw a truck with the Freak'N Brew logo and knew I was there.  There was a small sign on the door and a paper tapped to the door that said open. \n\nComing inside I was a little put off. First off the tasting room is super small. That's why it's called a tasting room, but what I didn't like was that it felt like an office complex waiting room. At least there is one TV and there was room at the bar for us to sit. I would have preferred they knock down the walls so we can see the tanks from the tasting room. Give it a real brewery feel. Oh well, to each is own just my two cents. \n\nWe ordered the taster flight. It was $10 for 6 different beers. They had. 3 versions if their Belgium pale ale. Each with different hops. That was my favorite if the bunch but I thought it was a little weak, at under 5% alcohol. I'm more of a IPA fan and I like them in the 6-7 % range. \n\nAfter trying all the beers I really wasn't impressed. But that a personal preference. I'll totally give them more chances because I know they do brew IPAs, they just didn't have any today. As with most new breweries it takes a while to get everything working and to get more beers. \n\nIf anyone reads my reviews I'm a huge fan of breweries and huge supporter if local AZ beer. So for that reason I will come back and support Freak. I doubt they will knock down walls, but the service was great, people in the tasting room seemed happy, and the owners came out and thanked us for coming by. For those reason I will be back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ebJngmBku-3K4LGkub0j0w"}

I would rather have some smaller 2-tops that could be combined or pulled apart.\n\nBeer was a bit pricey, but not out of the norm for other breweries or pubs. The IPAs have some decent flavor and aren't the hop biting type. There's a nice mellow saison that's great for summer. \n\nPlace doesn't serve any food, but I'm sure they'd be fine with bringing some of your own. \n\nPatrons were all very nice and friendly.

You would be spending a few bucks more at the Metro Market for some of their wines and sea pak items like the shrimp scampi than Woodmans which is why I believe they are a good place to pick up items versus shopping. \n\nOverall, the store is very nicely designed.

We enjoyed bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, crispy pork belly sushi rolls, sake and sesame Japanese eggplant, chicken mole, sliced 35 day dry aged New York strip steak, sliced over fresh mushrooms and a coconut milk sauce with roasted leeks, tuna ceviche tossed in Aji Amarillo sauce and served in a coconut placed in an ice bowl, hamachi sashimi in a mysterious green sauce garnished with micro greens, and many more.  Tried a Magic Mojito, made with frozen horchata and loads of fresh mint, and a Passion Fruit cocktail with Mescal, passion fruit juice and ginger beer in a copper mug.\n\nService is well trained and savvy.  Interiors are high end design, with innovations such as a green grassy perimeter fence on the patio hung with giant, framed mirrors, movable shade screens that enclose the patios while misters and massive air conditioning capacity cool both indoor and outdoor space, and a huge man made tree in the main dining area.  Exhibition kitchen.  \n\nLocated in a new strip center at the northwest corner of Scottsdale Road and Lincoln Drive.  Entrees are smallish plates best shared with your table mates.

Really well designed space with a giant tree in the middle and clean, modern design with tricked out lighting. We were greeted welcomingly at the host stand then promptly seated at the sushi bar. At first it was a little overwhelming - I mean sushi, multiple kinds of salsa, tacos, pho - a mixed bag of asian/mexican as promised so we decided to order a course off of each menu area.\n\nWe started with the Suzuki Roll - beautiful and delicious with just the perfect amount of crunch and heat. Then we had the lump crab guacamole - with the guac itself being very tasty and well put together and the 'lump' crab being somewhat lacking for a $14 dish. Our conclusion was we'd order the guac again but skip on the crab.\n\nMoving on we had the Mexican Pho - a tasty take on the Vietnamese classic with queso and cilantro. Yum. Along with that the mussels, some of the largest i've seen, in a green coconut & lime - terrific heavy cream sauce that didn't seem too out of the ordinary in a Mexican fusion way.\n\nThen we ordered tacos - they were already out of Pastor so we opted for Chicken - these were tasty little morsels of goodness on some kind of fresh corn tortilla. \n\nWe were already getting full so we opted to wait to do any of the larger entree style or wok prepared items. We finished off with an Hamachi roll with slices of fresh jalapeno on top. Yumm.

Peg and I were curious about this place when it first began to surface. The adage about eating with your eyes was noted over a hundred years ago but it has never been more apparent than when you walk into Sumo Maya. Walking into the Jeff Lowe inspired and created atmosphere was very impressive and inviting. We've been there twice since it opened, trying to sample a variety of the Mex-Asian fusion. The street tacos are very good (we had taco carnitas) they were fresh and delicious. The Mexican-style summer corn topped with popcorn was tasty and the crispy calamari was sampled both times...and will be again!  I must say that the bacon wrapped medjool dates were incredibly flavorful and instantly addictive..and they were also repeated and will likely become a steady accompaniment.. Sushi is presented beautifully and so fresh tasting. The New York strip was very flavorful and as tender as it was, the duck breast was just as comforting. The open concept kitchen is done a lot with new restaurants, and this was especially inviting and playful...the full kitchen to the sushi station. Chef Matt and crew were engaged with both cooking and guests. John was our server (we asked for him specifically the second time) and he is the perfect blend of attentive but not gratuitous. The heart and soul of the place is Chef Herb Wilson, and his pedigree is very impressive.  Tai Hunt (GM) and Alex Davis (Mgr) were obviously involved in customer satisfaction and provided insight into making customer-services a priority.  We are thrilled to see this place hit the ground running, and will add it to our short list of must returns.

When I first heard of a Mexican Asian restaurant opening up, I had no idea what to expect but I figured that since I like both cuisines, I would probably enjoy it. I was right. They did a great job fusing the cuisines. In fact, what took the relationship so long to bloom!? \n\nAmbiance:\n\nLooks are deceiving and the exterior of this place looks nothing like the interior. From the outside, you'd think it just looks like any other generic restaurant, but don't be deceived. Step through the doors and you immediately enter this open, airy and trendy restaurant that even has a real tree hanging out in the middle of the restaurant...yes a tree! I especially found the pictures of random people on the chairs pretty entertaining. The restaurant itself has a combination of a wrap around bar and then dining area. Make a reservation to be on the safe side! This is great spot for a night out with friends, a double date or event a spot to get a couple cocktails and apps! \n\nFood & Drinks: \n\nNow, moving on to the most important part, food and drinks! First, the drinks. I enjoyed the Passion Fruit sangria and boy does that pack a punch! I expected it to be sweet, but instead it was pretty potent...in a good way! Next, the food. This restaurant is all about sharing the plates and it's nice because that means you can try much more! Everything on the menu looked delicious, so our group of four ordered it all! \n\nGuacamole - they serve up some of the most unique guacamole choices I've ever seen! We decided to order the Lump Crab Guacamole. I'm ruined because I don't think I will ever be able to enjoy \"regular\" guacamole again. It was the perfect amount of crab and the key lime added a tasty twist. The only downfall was that it only came with four tortilla chips and if you wanted to order more, it was $1 more per order of chips. The guacamole is already $14, so with the additional chips, it made for a pricey appetizer! \n\nRock Shrimp Tempura - I'm such a fan of rock shrimp and especially when it has some Asian flavoring to it. This dish was anything but disappointing and I could have gobbled this dish up all by myself! The rock shrimp tempura comes with a variety of veggies including tomatoes and green beans. The summer mayo had the perfect flavorful kick to it. I want my own order next time!\n\nRollo Chingon Sushi Roll (cooked) - This roll comes with grilled shrimp, guacamole, jalapeno and has a balsamic strawberry glaze. See where they do a good job fusing the two cuisines? I had no idea I was eating a Mexican food sushi roll because it tasted delicious! It came with eight bites and was great for sharing.\n\nSuzuki Roll - This roll was another great Mexican Asian combo with spicy tuna, avocado, and then a chipotle aioli! They have eight bites in a roll so this was another good one to share and very flavorful. \n\nSummer Corn - order this! I loved it and could have eaten it all on my own. The spiced popcorn on top of the corn created an interesting yet flavorful kick to it! \n\nBacon Wrapped Dates - an order comes with six, so there's plenty to share however you will want more than one! These little guys are so good! The combination of salty bacon and sweet date compliments each other perfectly.\n\nHalf Lobster _ Crab Dynamite - order this but be warned, you won't want to share! This was the best thing I ate on the menu! \n\nAfter my experience, I would say that my top three favorite things I ate were the rock shrimp, corn and lobster/crab. I would order the three items next time but I would probably order the lobster as my own entree next time. It's that good!", "type": "review", "business_id": "j1Ii8r1H4AZ0FAbJAdk3Qw"}

It's an Asain Mexican fusion inspired menu which features some amazing food. My best friend and I do dinner at least once a month and are always trying out new spots.  We have uniformly christened this as the official mac daddy. Here's why...\n\nAmbiance is fantastic. When all the sliding glass doors are open the whole restaurant is patio like. With the A/C  running full blast you never feel the wretched AZ heat, yet it's like your dining al fresco. They even have a very large tree (albeit fake) inside the restaurant. Aside from at least 15 4-top tables (which I'm sure can be slid together to accommodate large parties) I saw inside, there are also few half booth half tables. Not to mention they have a large patio with booths, tables and high tops.\n\nThere's not only a sushi bar to sit at but also a \"kitchen bar\" which surrounds the open kitchen. Pretty cool. We sat a the bar ( which is rather large, and features 2 large projection television screens ) to take advantage of happy hour. Their bar stools cushioned seats with backs (plus!)\n\nOn to the food/drinks...\n\nTheir drink menu consists of 15 or so specialty cocktails. (All $2 off on happy hour) Some martinis, some frozen, some on the rocks. All have interesting ingredients that you wont find in many places. I tried the \"Coconut\" and the \"Kumquat\". Both were fantastic. They also have a lengthy sake menu. Aside from several specialty beers on draft they have \"Patron\" on draught. Ice cold tequila shots that aren't watered down? Yes please! They have a decent wine list as well. \n\nTo eat we ordered several things to share. First round was the bacon wrapped dates and wild mushroom tacos. Both were stellar. The bacon wrapped around the dates was cooked to perfection. The chorizo and queso fresco filling was warm,creamy and paired perfectly with the sweetness of the dates. It was honestly one of the best dishes I've ever had. The tacos weren't close behind in flavor and will be ordered again. (FYI during happy hour you can 4 of ANY of their tacos and a 32oz beer for $14)\n\nSecond round was the braised pork belly, coconut mussels and the mango habenero salmon ceviche. The pork belly was demolished almost instantaneously because well it's pork belly and who doesn't like pork belly!? The mussels were served in a delicious coconut, lime and ginger broth. They were the biggest mussels I have ever seen and tasted very fresh. Melted in my mouth. I just wish they were served with something to sop up the glorious nectar the mussels were served in! The salmon ceviche was decent, I wish there was more of a kick to it. Just needed something but that's probably just me. The salmon itself was very fresh though I must say. \n\nFor dessert we opted for the trio of creme brule. Kumquat, chocolate raspberry and green tea were being served that night. The green tea was my favorite. Perfect way to end a delicious meal. \n\nFinally, our bartender Katelyn was great. She helped guide us through the menu and recommended several of the items we ordered and she was spot on! We will be back to see her!", "type": "review", "business_id": "j1Ii8r1H4AZ0FAbJAdk3Qw"}

Didn't have to contend with too many other customers at the time which was a huge bonus.\n\nSeeing as the restaurant is new, there were a few execution issues I noticed with our meal. The sea bass was overly seasoned and I kept looking for something to help cut the saltiness. The garnishes on the plate didn't help much in that respect. The overall flavor and concept of the dish was nice though. Def would try again.Their sushi was beautifully presented but wasn't rolled (or packed, since the pieces were square) very tightly.

When you walk in and you get the feeling you are one of those beautiful people in a movie that's in a really cool place somewhere. Oh But Yes you are it's Scottsdale AZ !  Asian and Latin Faces are sprinkled on some of the seats and a big really Real Looking tree is planted in the dining room. The Beautiful Restaurant was also pristine clean like a hospital.\n\nOur waiter was very welcoming and explained the menu to us. The food is Asian Mexican Fusion and is TAPAS Style meaning you share small plates and do need to order 2 - 3 plates a person even at lunch time.\n\nWe started with the Korean Beef Tacos and the Miso Eggplant. Both were delicious and oh so delicate I think someone must have very good eye sight and used tweezers to add all the tiny delicate flowers and micro veggies in the right places on both these dishes. The Eggplant is a must get dish, it's creamy eggplant flesh that's slightly sweet and laced with miso and sake and also  adorned with sesame seeds. I would say the same about the Tacos  that are just as delicate and are also highly detailed and ARE DELICIOUS. But I do think they should up the price a few dollars and give you more tacos because my photo doesn't show you how small they really are. They are smaller than street tacos and you only get two to share. They were delicious and delicate but they were only a very small taste as they are only two bites at the most.\n\nWe also shared the Crispy Chicken Mole, another must get dish. Like everything else the presentation of the food was EXQUISITE! The dish was made with really moist delicious Chicken and Sweet Plantains and pickled red onions to cut the richness of the mole. It wasn't big on crisp but was really oh so delicious and I sure wouldn't mind getting it again.\n\nFor lunch this was more of a splurge but this is the kind of place when you want something special and different. I thought dinner prices were reasonable as they didn't differ so much from lunch.\n\nI don't know if everything on the menu is as delicious as what I tried but sure will come back again to find out!\n\nThe only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars are the tacos as interesting and delicious as they were. They were smaller than street tacos and you only got two for $7.00. For me I think either the tacos should become slightly bigger or they should up the price a few dollars and give you four tacos to share.\n\nI note everything else I tried seemed in line with what it should cost.\n\nService was very welcoming and very efficient. \n\nI can't wait to try this place out for dinner!\n\n4.5 Stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "j1Ii8r1H4AZ0FAbJAdk3Qw"}

Lively place too with music going a good \"crowd\" noise that isn't overbearing but you also don't feel like you're in a library either. We couldn't get a table without reservations but any of the bar seating was available. So we sat at the kitchen bar which was a bee hive of activity. Very cool. Our waiter David instantly took over and started making recommendations. Drink choices were awesome! David went through the menu as fusion food can be overwhelming  with choices. We made a couple selections but thankfully David helped out with some.  The best way to order was what he recommended, family style and lots of dishes everyone eats from. The range of flavors from sushi to carnitas tacos is out of this world. The food was so incredible, not a bad choice (and I'll tell you I'm a pretty picky eater). The wait staff checked on us and brought food as ready.  \n\nEverything about Sumo Maya is top notch. If you go ask to sit in David's section if he's working.

I decided to play it safe and reserve a table for 6:00 p.m. on Saturday evening. At first I thought I was probably over-cautious with a reservation so early, but the dining room was packed! I think the only available seating was around the bar, which was humming.\n\nAs everyone else says, the space is open, colorful, breezy and beautiful. I loved every little detail--the vases, lights, knick-knacks, intricate metal candle holders, all with a heavy dose of bright magenta pink and orange. It was trendy and welcoming and just right. The open garage door walls made for perfect summer dinner ambiance.\n\nOur server was sweet and explained the menu thoroughly, and gave us some recommendations. Our haul:\n\n-Sake sangria for me: sake, cucumber vodka, ginger, other assortment of flavors to make for an absolutely refreshing cocktail\n\n-Traditional guacamole (I'm eyeballing the pomegranate/dried fruit gauc for next time) and house-fried chips. This was magnificent. The queso fresco and citrus notes of the chunky guac made it some of the best I've ever had in a restaurant. To be honest, I think it's a little silly that you only receive 5 chips in total (and they are amazing--crispy and perfectly seasoned) and another order of chips is $1. But I don't want that to take away from how delicious this dish was.\n\n-Mushroom tacos: Perfect little street tacos with AMAZING smoky-grilled mushrooms. These were perfection. I could eat about 10 of these, if left to my own devices. I put a little leftover guacamole on mine---tastebud party.\n\n-Shishito peppers: Shishitos have become a personal obsession of mine over the past year and if they are on the menu, you can bet I will order them. The ample portion came tossed in a delicious soy caramel glaze. Word to the wise, these are marked as Vegetarian on their menu, but are topped with bonito flake (dried fish flakes). Seeing as I'm becoming increasingly \"meh\" in my vegetarianism, I just ate the ones on the bottom. I wasn't passing up these beauts!\n\nFinally, I chose the sumo green roll to round out the meal. A perfect portion of a veggie roll, topped with a tasty tomatillo salsa. Boyfriend had the lamb chop, which I thought was a teensy bit tiny for $12, but he said it was absolutely delicious. \n\nWe thought we couldn't handle any other food, but then our gal ran through the dessert list. HOLY. We ended up on their take of a tres leches cake, topped with toasted whipped cream, drenched in what seemed like melted ice cream (I'm sure there is a more fancy word for this) with a side of chocolate crispies (again, I'm sure something fancier than what I'm describing). It was honestly? Life changing. The other desserts sounded just as amazing. Mexican chocolate lava cake with a horchata drizzle? Trio of paletas?!\n\nAll in all, what a perfect addition to the neighborhood. If I'm feeling like a special occasion dinner, I'm probably choosing Sumo Maya!", "type": "review", "business_id": "j1Ii8r1H4AZ0FAbJAdk3Qw"}

I have to say literally everything that was put on our table was amazing.

Went with a couple friends and I honestly had no idea it was a new spot till the waiter told me. Well let's start off with the fact that we got there at 4ish so dinner was not yet ready (starts at 5) and we had to sit either by the bar or high top tables. I was a bit bothered by that since it was 3 of us and we were starving. I did not want to share a tiny small table, but we did anyways! \n\nSince the whole dinner thing and not being able to sit at a regular table did bother us at first. We just decided to only have an appetizer/drink and head on to another place but those minutes flew by and the appetizers came out so quick, we were very surprised. I ordered chicken tacos and even though they are super tiny they were AMAZING! Also the calamari was so flavorful. I asked the waitress to surprise me with a drink and she brought out a coconut beverage that was so good and had just the right amount of alcohol in it. We ended up waiting till 5 to move to a bigger table for dinner. No joke we ordered about 10 different plates and they were all wonderful! The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because they offer rice but NO BEANS!  I LOVE BEANS! How could they do this to me! Lol well either way I will probably come back anyways. I had a second drink which was a coconut/pineapple margarita. The waiter did not mention it was frozen which I did not like but either way it was STRONG! (Very well worth your money if I may say so).

It's Mexican/Asian fusion so you'd think they might consider that not everyone eats with chopsticks and set the tables with forks - but there you are.  Regardless, after asking a 3rd time and still not receiving forks, one of us got up and happened to find the manager and ask for some.  Dang if that guy didn't cop an attitude right away, get defensive, then rude...and then almost sneer about it every time he later passed our table.

If you're going to eat here, it's really important to know what to order so that you don't end up with any disappointments. My husband and I both studied the yelp reviews and our instagram feeds to help guide us, but we still ended up with some stinkers.\n\nWhat was excellent: 3 of our 4 cocktails! My husband's drink combined tamarind and rye, sort of like a manhattan. I got the green magic mojito, and the combo of coconut and mint was divine. I especially loved the whipped coconut cream on top. My second cocktail was their take on Pegu Club's amazing pisco punch. The SumoMaya version was crazy good too. For food, we loved the buttery, soft eggplant dish. Even if you think you hate eggplant, you may very well like this. Good portion for the price too. My husband said his yellowtail roll was far better than any he's had in AZ. The fish was fresh and not mushy like other places.\n\nWhat was pretty good: The guacamole with togarashi was a great, albeit very expensive, starter. I might start sprinkling togarashi on my guac at home now. My husband liked salmon ceviche a lot but was yearning for kumquats in every bite. With that little tweak, it would have been excellent. Cocktail number 4, the passionfruit drink with mezcal, was decent but didn't come close to the yumminess of the others.\n\nThe misses: the summer corn. So bland. I don't know why I keep ordering this type of dish because I can make awesome Mexican corn at home. I guess I keep waiting to get surprised. The sumo green roll needed a lot of help from soy and wasabi. My husband thought it was awful. His hamachi ceviche was a let down too.

We had a quick dinner at the bar last night, and the food is so good that I want to write a quick review.  \n\nIt's a cool restaurant physically, although the high ceilings kill a bit of the intimacy, and probably costs them a fortune in air conditioning.  We sat at the bar, which is large and comfortable, and ordered our dinner there.  \n\nThere were a LOT of people working behind the bar.  I didn't count, but it looked like they were tripping over one another.  Our bartender was very nice, even replacing a drink I didn't like that I ordered from the cocktail menu.  But the service isn't completely dialed in at Sumo yet.  For instance, I ordered the FABULOUS mushroom tacos, but a server brought over chicken tacos.  I told him it was wrong, and instead of taking them back to the kitchen, he got in a bit of an argument with our bartender, and our bartender showed him our ticket twice because he seemed to want someone to blame.  It was an unnecessary conversation in front of a guest, and he should've simply apologized and brought the right dish.  This was all on the server, not our bartender.  \n\nEvery food item we ordered was splendid.  I had the tacos, my wife ordered the Kimchi fried rice, and we had the traditional guac.  We ordered some garbanzo beans, too, but somehow they didn't get into the computer, but we didn't finish the guac, so it was no huge loss.  We are vegetarians, and we were very happy with the wide variety offered to veggie customers.  My only complaint is that you get a ton of guac and too little of the bread for dipping, which is another $1.  I can afford another dollar, but it seems cheap on the restaurant's part, but that's a small complaint for what was a great meal.\n\nFor drinks I ordered the top two items on the cocktail menu: a five spice rum drink and a coconut drink.  I didn't find either remarkable, but I'm willing to keep going down the menu on future visits. \n\nThe crowd is pretty typical Scottsdale, which is generally a turnoff for me and I tend to stay on my home turf in central Phoenix, but I'll venture down Lincoln Rd and sneak in again soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j1Ii8r1H4AZ0FAbJAdk3Qw"}

It's got everything a new, trendy Scottsdale spot should have. Weird fusion food, an eclectic yet tasteful interior decorating job, wooden chairs (the ones that look like they could have come out of someone's old barn, but really they cost $500 each from Restoration Hardware), mismatched, waitresses who look like they could work nights at El Hefe in their booty shorts, and an open floor-plan concept. It's got it all.\n\nIf you don't know what Mexican-Asian fusion food is, don't worry. No one else does either. But it's dang tasty! I like that SumoMaya sounds like it would be way too off-the-grid type of food to be enjoyable, but they actually do a good job of separating their menu into a Mexican category and an Asian category so people don't get too freaked out. I ended up having the Duck Breast, something I thought I'd be going out on a limb ordering, but it was amaaaaaazing. Very tender, full of flavor, and I would happily order it again.\n\nI didn't have any cocktails, but my friends had plenty of them since we were there for a birthday, and everyone had great things to say about their drinks. I tried one of them, the Passionfruit, and it was to die for. It's similar to a margarita, but they mix in some ginger beer for a little zing and a little fizz, and you should definitely order it.\n\nAll in all, great experience. The service was pretty slow. I was the last to get my drink, and all I got was a red wine, and the last to get my food (but it was duck breast so I'm cool wit that). Otherwise, it was great, and our server was very nice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j1Ii8r1H4AZ0FAbJAdk3Qw"}

The decor and layout was nice, but the food failed to deliver on taste.\nDish 1- guacamole with lump crab and key lime: not enough lime nor cilantro, crab pieces doesn't have the seafood taste to it (fail)\nDish 2 - crispy calamari with sweet chile, chile, sesame and lime: the calamari pieces were drenched in the sweet chile sauce, which was extremely sweet, that I can't taste the chile nor the lime (fail)\nDish 3 - Korean beef Taco with soy, sake, sesame, and kimchee: I was expecting sliced BBQ Kalbi beef. But instead, it was a kind of pulled pork style beef.  Doesn't taste that bad, but no Korean style by any standard (not bad)\nDish 4 - Kimchi fried rice: there was no kimchee to be found in the whole dish. It tastes like Chinese fried rice with a lot of mushrooms. It lacked the red chile flavor that is in all kimchee fried rice. Super salty as well.(Epic fail)\nDish 5 - Pad Thai Al Pastor: again, not authentic at all. Noodle wasn't cook all the way through. Very salty as well. ( so so)\nDish 6 - Vietnamese style shaking beef: I have to honestly say that it was delicious; however, $24 for 8 little pieces of beef was a little pricey even for Scottsdale (yum)\nDesserts: mochi: store bought so nothing to say yay or nat about.  There were 4 dishes that I wanted to order and was told are out. I was here at 8 on a Saturday night. Hmmmm....

Flowing along the Lazy River, that's how!\n\nThat's exactly what I got to do, and so much more!\n\n1st off I have to say Yelp Phoenix is amazing! Lindsey did an amazing job teaming up with Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak for this event! Not only was a great pool party, it was a pool party with a cause! Yelp Phoenix brought in more than 5000 bottle of water to give to St Mary's Food Bank! HOW FREAKING AMAZING IS THAT!\n\nAll I had to do was bring in a 24pack of water to gain access to this amazing party!\nThere was pools with waterfalls, volley ball nets, slides and the lazy river to just forget your worries and float on by (my only worry was to keep my hair dry but one good dunkin off the float and that worry no longer existed haha)\n\nThe boys from Jacked Ice were on deck, I LOVE THEM!  Have been lucky enough now to have caught them at 3 events so far, soo FANGIRLING after them! It's the best, an adult snow cone!  \n\nDizzy was there greeting everyone with smiles and his fun balloon creations. This party was opened for all ages and it was great seeing soo many Yelpers with their family. DJ Sterling was rocking the beats! He always keeps us on our feet!\n\nDon't forget the great team that bbq's us some burgers & dogs, and the delish rootbeer floats too! \n\nThis was a fun packed pool party for sure! Thank you Lindsey, Rachel the Yelp Phoenix Team for this great event and a big Thank you to The Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak for having us!   \n\nSuch a fun Sunday! Every Sunday should be like that!", "type": "review", "business_id": "B0M3_Y-vtglFswwPUQecLg"}

It's nice to know even when it's scorching triple digits, there are places people can go for water. \n\nNow, let's be honest. This event rocked! Thanks for picking a beautiful location at the Hilton Point Squaw Peak with a super dooper water slide, the oh-so-lazy river and not to mention all the sweet extras Lindsey hooked up with DJ STERLING keeping the party alive, Dizzy bustin' out some insane balloon hat skills, a yummy BBQ and Jacked Ice snow cones! It felt like I was a kid at the community pool again! \n\nMy plus one, Josh W. challenged Dizzy and asked for a fun hat with vegetables, so Dizzy topped that with a full on Chiquita banana hat! I was really impressed! \n\nI'm really excited to plan another day trip to the lazy river with the coupon we were given.

We checked out the Yelp area, which was kind of weird because it was waaay in the back and my husband and I had to trek through the mini golf course to get there!

However first impressions are excellent.  I was a bit nervous about the crowd I am a \"curvier\" girl and was happy to see not everyone a rock hard scottsdale body but I was pleasantly surprised how all shapes and sizes were there and how friendly everyone was I even made a new friend and hopeful work out buddy!!!!\n\nSo the run down; one stop shop for all the boutique gym you have memberships too (Hot Yoga, Flow Yoga, Yoga, Spin, TRX, Barre, Boxing, HIIT and Crossfit)  Really the only thing missing is Pilates.  I have always wanted to try Barre but with already having one $150 membership I hadn't tried for fear of liking too much and I don't need to spend $300 on two boutquie studios, but now I don't have too.\n\nI did spin today and took Stephanie's class with DJ Shadow, I have personally always been a huge fan of Stephanie's spin class and I was happy to see Wendy will be teaching she has great music.  The bikes for one are not La Mond and have the multi hand positions and ride a lot like soul cycle bikes for those of you out there like me that are a sucker for SC.  \n\nSpin room had great air flow with cubbies if you don't want to use the locker room (more on that later)  Room is dark with some low lighting and a DJ booth.  I am sold and can't wait to try some of the other teachers.\n\nTomorrow I am trying Hot Yoga however I bet that I will probably ended up in the regular yoga or Heat Flow, but I figured I would give it a shot, I am really hoping it is slower and like Bikram with music, if so I will probably be doing everyday.\n\nJuice Bar:  I tried the Hangover and LOVED it, juice bar is straight forward Juices and Smoothies.  You can pre order as well.  \n\nLocker Room:  YEY!  a place to get ready, open space with two showers and a space to do hair and makeup, towels provided.  \n\nPrice:  I signed up for unlimited $110, from my understanding they will increase roughly $10 for every 500 or so memberships until they end up at their final membership price around $150-ish.  \n\nLocation:  Parking is going to be the largest challenge, your best bet is to go straight for the garage or in my case just ride my bike the mile.  I am hopping that because most classes are mornings and evenings during the week parking won't be awful, however weekends and holidays with the mall open might be tight.  \n\nCons:  Wish they had some hot breakfast items and maybe salad or sandwiches you can gran on the go.  to be honest I am not sure if they might have this in there future plans already.  Although they do offer nutritional services and might take them up on it.\n\nOverall I am really excited to attend some more classes and hopefully update to 5 stars.  Will keep you posted as I try the other classes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xbswoo00rr2qaiiMFjUMqg"}

Also, they are using the same class instructors that I see regularly at Lifetime and 24hour fitness, so nothing out of the ordinary there. The class offerings are nothing out of the ordinary either: Crossfit, Cycle, Yoga, HIIT. Overall, I just don't find the concept all that impressive.

At Fit Republic, so far I have taken 4 classes and found all of the instructors to be awesome!  As a person that really likes to mix up my workout routine, I love having so many top-notch classes to choose from with knowledgeable and motivating instructors.  So far I have taken Spin, Barre/TRX, HIIT and Boxing and I left the classes feeling challenged and excited to do it again. I'll be taking yoga this week as well.   I'm looking forward to trying the Crossfit fundamentals class as Crossfit has always intimidated me!  The facility is gorgeous and I love how each room gives you a totally different feel.  You can tell the owners put a lot of thought into each room and focused on giving the customers a quality experience.  \n\nThe locker rooms are a really nice place to get ready for your day when you are on the go with gorgeous showers and plenty of space.  I love that I can preorder my smoothie from the juice bar and have it ready for me as class gets out.  \n\nMy only complains are that they don't rent/sell cycling shoes or heart rate monitors.  I would definitely utilize both rental options.  They also didn't have enough boxing gloves for everyone, which slowed down the pace of the class.  \n\nOverall, I am a happy new citizen!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xbswoo00rr2qaiiMFjUMqg"}

The facility is gorgeous, the staff is super friendly and you can tell they're all excited to help open the place and connect with the community.  \n\nThe past three days I've taken spin, HIIT, and barre.  Depending on what boutique studios you have been to around the Valley, the classes may not entirely live up to your expectations.  I was a little disappointed in the barre class - it seemed disorganized with no real flow, it was difficult to see/hear the instructor because of the room's layout, and there was no emphasis on form which is really key for this workout.  I have done a lot of barre workouts so it made less of a difference to me, but could completely see how some people may not return if that was their first barre experience.  On the other hand, some friends tried barre for the first time this weekend and loved it - so maybe lack of expectations is a benefit!  The Spin class was great (although I wish there were mirrors at the front and that the rooms were darker) - I am a Spin freak - my only gripe is that the bikes are horrible to adjust, I wish they had LeMonds.  Someone needs to be available (in addition to the instructor) to help people get set up, especially if they are new to Spin - a poorly fitted bike will make or break your ride and you could tell a lot of people in my classes were new and had no idea how to adjust or fit the bikes.  It would be also awesome if they rented spin shoes - again, something that I highly promote for all spinners that makes a huge difference on your ride!  The HIIT class was amazing (take Kenyatta's class!) and this weekend was able to watch a few other HIIT classes in session and can tell all the instructors all lead different types of work outs.  Excited to check out some of the other classes like TRX, boxing, and even though I am keeping my membership at a different hot yoga studio, I want to check out both of their yoga studios as well.  \n\nWith all of that being said, I am already a \"citizen\" and am amped about it.  I have had ongoing combinations of memberships to other boutique studios for spin, yoga, or barre which have cost more individually than one month at Fit Republic alone where I can get them all, so joining was a no brainer for me.  Some of my fav instructors from around the Valley were brought on board and let's be honest - many of these instructors have a \"following\" for a reason - because they are amazing!  I have never belonged to a \"traditional\" gym, but would venture to say that the classes and instructors are not nearly on the same level as the classes offered at Fit Republic.  If classes offered at a gym are just a bonus for you, I can see why it may not be the best fit, but if you love the quality and community of a boutique studio and thrive in group settings, Fit Republic is the way to go.\n\nThe locker rooms are gorgeous and I would actually feel comfortable getting ready there after a class - lots of space, four showers, and you can tell it will be well maintained/cleaned throughout the day.  The Cafe is awesome - great smoothies/juices - and has a lot of tables so you can hang out before and in-between classes.  The Cafe is in the center of the five rooms - most you can see into - so it's neat to see what the other classes are like before actually checking them out.  If you're going during mall business hours, definitely allow some extra time to park.  \n\nOnly reasons I am at four stars and not five are the bikes and the barre class.  Everything else - staff, facility, class schedule, pricing, cafe, instructors - all get five stars!  A few friends of mine have already joined this weekend as well and let's just say...we are actively recruiting and poaching our friends that belong to other studios to come to the dark side with us! ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xbswoo00rr2qaiiMFjUMqg"}

Visited around 1:00 PM and sat in the bar, served by Julie who was very nice and friendly and attentive. Ordered the burger with 1/2 order onion rings and 1/2 order of fries. Burger was average, fries were not that hot and the onion rings were not as good as I remember them when I used to visit one of their Scottsdale locations. Looked like the kitchen may have used a spatula to cut into the burger to see if it was cooked properly. I remember the food being better than this visit.\nVisited again a few days later on Friday. Three of us ordered food. The veggie burger's bun was served up hard, over toasted? The sweet potato chips are like potato chips and were not freshly made to order. My pizza slice was very bad. Little if any sauce on the dough less than average amount of cheese, sausage added to the top of the slice and then covered with grated parmesian cheese, the slice was not reheated so the cheese did not melt into the slice nor could it given the type of cheese used. SO SO disappointed in the pizza. We also ordered a 1000 Island burger. The burger was drenched in 1000 Island dressing and sat in a pool of sauce. Impossible to pick up to eat. This burger too appeared to have been cut into to determine if cooked properly. Sent it back to be redone and 2 minutes later the same food came out in a new basket without all the 1000 Island dressing, naturally the bun was soaked from before. Needless to say we walked out after discussing the issues with management and receiving $5 vouchers. Not sure we even want to try a 3rd visit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KUVq5crwY9oBNMzbevZ0Rg"}

From my short time living in Arizona, I can tell that sports bars are hugely popular here (not that they aren't popular elsewhere).

Parking does get sparse when a big game is on, so you may have to park on the street.\n\nI came here for Happy Hour and ordered a Strawberrry Zipparita for $4 and some french fries. The zipparita was really yummy and strong (guess that's why they limit it to 3 per person) but the french fries were pretty standard and nothing to write home about.

I can't speak to normal days here, but if the service and experience I had is any indication, they should have no problem keeping the masses happy during regular business hours.\n\nAs with so many sports bars, this place was incredibly packed for the US World Cup games.  Zipps new location in Glendale is more than worthy of the crowds they got as they have dozens of TVs across the entire restaurant plus a big jumbotron TV in the middle of the restaurant.  There's tons of seating in the restaurant and the bar area, all with great viewing angles.\n\nBoth times I came here for the games, the service from the waitresses was prompt, professional, and friendly.  Even with standing room only crowds, I never had an issue getting the attention of my waitress and she came by regularly to check on me.  The food here is pretty stand bar fare.  I've sampled a couple of different appetizers here now (quesadilla and chicken tenders) and its pretty much what I expected.  It was adequate and tasted pretty much like the food I've had at other Zipps locations.  I haven't had any of their main dishes yet so I can't speak to those.\n\nSo don't take this review as an indication of their broader food menu, but moreso as a great place to watch a big game.  The setup is awesome and the west valley residents have clearly embraced it.  One quick tip:  Park in the parking lot north of Melting Pot as the inner parking lot is super small and gets crowded.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KUVq5crwY9oBNMzbevZ0Rg"}

It took almost another half an hour to get those and what we received was not worth the money. My chicken focaccia was no more than chicken wrapped in a tortilla and for whatever reason the tortilla was wet and soggy. None of the shrimp on my husband's shrimp skewers were deveined so, he basically was not able to eat half of his meal. Naturally, I asked for the manager. When he came to our table he did not introduce himself, he only saId \"I hear there is a problem.\" I told him the situation and he asked if we would like anything else but we declined because we did not want to wait another 30 minutes for new food. All the manager did was take my entree off the bill because I did not eat any of it. Other customers in the restaurant were complaining about the food as well, one guy even asked us \"who did you talk to about the food up in this joke!\" The only positive thing I can say about Zipp's is, their Bloody Mary's are pretty good.

Very complex tastes mingled on my tongue, the potato-ish veggie flavor on the top followed by the sweet gel\u00e9e, deepened with the avocado. All completely grated, but I was still able to tell the texture, scoop and taste individually or all at once.\n\nThere came the second, more traditional kaiseki-like appetizer. This time, we could see the basic attributes of natural ingredients were preserved, yet amusing presentation of craftsmanship was well displayed. The finish of shrimp was like what we eat for Osechi that would bring back old timey memories. Satoimo (Japanese taro) came with tangy rock salt. Cucumber came hocho-crafted with mildly sweet moromi-miso. Deep fried lotus roots had perfect crunchiness that played nice in the mix. However, the edamame was lacking the finishing touch. Not only that the flavor was nothing special, it felt awkward to pull out beans from the pod by hand.\n\nWe chose Omurice (Rice Omelette) and Tonkotsu Ramen for the main.\n\nAs much as I would like to say the Omurice was perfect, it was also pretty basic to be honest. Considering that Omurice has been less accepted in the US market, I can understand that the straightforward path is a safe bet, but for matured taste buds like ours, some you-cannot-do-it-at-home factors seemed to be missing. My personal preference is rice less steamed and eggs more runny. Also I personally like demi-glace sauce better, or at least the ketchup could use some twist.\n\nNow the best part- the tonkotsu ramen! I was blown away. I know it's like cheating to compare ramen elaborated by a kaiseki chef with shops serving bowls in every 60 seconds, it was the best ramen I've had in this competitive Las Vegas market. The broth had very intricate flavors, but was not too greasy or heavy. Quite contrary, the aftertaste was pleasantly light. Chashu was a little sweetened, which added a unique perspective. Typically noodles are straight and thin for tonkotsu, but wavy noodles used by Omae worked to fully enjoy this rich-yet-not-too-rich broth.\n\nIn the end, all those three (plus drink) for $20 was a well considered price point. It's on a high-end for lunch, particularly for local clientele, but is a steal for the quality of food and service.\n\nSome obvious opening day flaws aside, this place is very promising. I spotted some misses in the food as described above, but I will hold off my full review until they start offering kaiseki, a big missing piece in the Las Vegas culinary scene.\n\n4 stars + 1 for a forward looking factor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cb4YeNdl6MUWis906tzFVQ"}

With such limited seating and quality of food,  I can see this place as the next hot spot in town! \n\nWe were there for the three course lunch.  First course was a chilled avocado soup.  I recommend spooning through all three layers to the bottom so you can taste the complexity of the soup.  Wonderful for the hot summer; refreshing and the perfect amount of salt and texture.  Second course was presented beautifully, the dusting of flavor of the shrimp was incredible - reminded me of a fresh shrimp ceviche.  The third course I chose the ramen.  I've had lots of ramen all over the place (in Asia as well as the states) and I've never tasted anything quite like this.  It was a wonderful porky broth with sesame and a charcoal-y, grilled flavor.  The meat is thicker than I like but was full of flavor and melted in my mouth.  My bowl of ramen seemed endless!  Couldn't finish everything....   \n\nSimilar to Raku and Kabuto in terms of food quality and service, but different in terms of type of food.  Raku to me is more traditional and Kabuto is strictly nigiri.  This place is like a modern twist on Japanese.  It's young and hip. \n\nWe met Chef Omae after our meal and he is so humble and nice.  Very cool guy, definitely come check this place out!  Beat the crowds so you can say you've been there, tasted that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cb4YeNdl6MUWis906tzFVQ"}

This is a 12 seat place, we took up 8 of the seats as we reserved two 4 stops. \n\n1st course - chilled vegetable soup was nice. It had nice texture and flavors. I chose not to mix it up so much so that I get ribbons of flavors. Refreshing, but had creamy aspects that also made it velvety in mouthfeel that I liked. \n\n2nd course- Petite appetizer. It was very simple and plain, and wished I had more of the paste on the side. Still, decent and beautiful plating. \n\n3rd course (you can get omurice, ramen, black curry) - I got the ramen which was very rich. The broth was thick that it was almost like sauce. The flavor was nice and I didn't think it was overly salty for being reduced down. The pork slices were tender, and I always appreciate getting a whole egg. \n\nYou get a choice of beverage. I went with ice green tea and appreciated it was nice strong matcha (not sweet). \n\nFor $20, it's not a bad lunch at all. I heard the menu will rotate a bit so I will be keeping my eyes peeled (on his twitter @TakashiOmae the menus are announced) as I would definitely return for the quality and price point. We don't have a legitimate kaiseki here, so I am very excited at the prospect of it once they can serve dinner.

So why would Las Vegas be any different?\n\nWe were initially going to go to Luna Lounge on the strip (Thanksgiving night and they were closed) so we ended up at Hookah Masters Lounge (HML) which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nHookah and Server: I will say I was a little hesitant when we walked in an the server was prancing around in underwear but she was wonderful! Super friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. My fiance is Arab and of course only smokes double-apple(no matter where we go) so of course this was different, but to our pleasant surprise they had Nakhala - which is what many traditional smokers use. The hookah wasn't ours (of course we think we have best at home) but it was good - the server was efficient at keeping hot coals on the hookah and consistently checking on us and each of the patrons...maybe her efficiency came from a lack of pants? Meh - she was was awesome. \n\nAtmosphere: and setup in a way that could accommodate several large groups of people. Being over the age of 18 we still decided to sit on that side of the establishment as it was more populated.  \n\nFood: Although we didn't actually eat there we did receive a menu to look over and by reviewing it they have a great selection ranging from appetizers, sandwiches, and entrees. Hummus, Hummus w/Sherwma, Mozzarella Sticks (can't go wrong with fried cheese), Sherwma Sandwhichs (Beef and Chicken), and even platters Beef Kabob, Chicken Kabob, and Kafta Kabob...

Wifi is free, which helps. There's hookah smoking here but no cigarette smoking allowed, which I appreciate because I can't stand that smell.\n\nLady we placed order with was friendly, her mom was the cook, order took about ten to fifteen minutes to come out, which was fairly reasonable. Had time to sit and look around, liked the lighting effects and modern d\u00e9cor/seating, but found it odd that they don't have more lights on during the day or anything to make it a little more restaurant-like for non-nightclub hours. \n\nFood itself was just okay: 12 piece spicy garlic wings just tasted like mild buffalo sauce and no garlic, for 12 wings we were given 2 tiny cups of ranch which would not have been sufficient if they were the spice temperature we actually ordered. The beef shish kabob wrap was dry and had no sauce, side of Caesar salad was bagged at an angle so the dressing dripped out of the box and all over the bag.\n\nEDIT: Subtracted an additional star after a traffic incident with an employee in a company truck covered in HML contact info and logos. He was speeding, tailgating, and nearly sideswiped my car in 5 o'clock traffic about a block away from the lounge. Dangerous on it's own, unprofessional when representing your company.

Order it during Happy Hour (after 9PM) and get 2 tacos for $5.50. The Carne taco also great - tender and savory, almost Lengua-like.\n\nThe Camaron (shrimp) taco is slathered in what they call \"Chipotle Mojo\" sauce which is an orange-colored, Sunday sauce-like (but Mexican) curry-like concoction. It also makes an appearance on their nacho plates. The repurposing of this sauce on multiple menu items is questionable, and something about the look of it is a little off-putting. On the shrimp taco it completely shrouds the ingredients in an opaque orange layer. Close your eyes and it tastes alright, but the overall visual is somewhat IKEA-cafeteria-like. All tacos are served on skinny, rectangular plates, so aim your taco droppings well or you'll be saying \"Chipotle Uh-oh\" on yer pants.\n\nThe nachos have potential - served on a hot metal vessel atop a wooden plank. But I wish the nachos were made with 3X more warm hockey-game queso, like the famed Isla Nachos of pre-2013 Treasure Island days... Nacho Daddy is the closest you'll find these days.\n\nMercadito's Habanero salsa and other salsas on the side will be charged for to the tune of $3.50+, so heat-seekers be warned. The Habanero salsa itself lacks punch - probably the weakest Habanero heat I've experienced since the Habanero salsa craze started. Absolutely no comparison to the *free* secret Habanero served at Javier's.\n\nI'm a fan of the Mexican cocktail menu. The 'Misty Sleeve' was hibiscus-y and refreshing. At $10.50 though, it's all the money. A solid, standard Margarita will set you back $8.50. Not terribly pricey, but not five bucks.\n\nEnjoyed the warm 3-corn pico, but was hard to eat in a shallow glass bowl. Keeping the kernels from flying off the edge was challenging.\n\nCurrently running a pretty slangin' deal on Tuesdays for 'industry folk': 50% off your check!\n\nPrices are generally above-average for average Mexican fare. This place is trying to compete with the likes of Javier's (at Aria) but lacks the generous portions, go-for-it flavors, and beautiful plating/presentation. If you're gonna charge 5X-6X more than a taco stand, your food needs to please your palate at least 2X more. That's weird going-out-to-eat math, but ni modo!", "type": "review", "business_id": "vZ4CIMfeos6K7OyYDIlwrQ"}

We went on July 4th afternoon. we got there about 5 minutes to 4pm where we were told in a very terse voice that \"We don't open until 4pm\" - no offer of you can wait etc but being the rude NYC transplant I am, I plopped my arse down on one of their hobbit sized chairs and waited. \nOk 1st lets just say.. you are leasing space in a prime spot in a very busy casino and it's on a holiday - perhaps you should look at your market - and not stick to rules that apply to cities that are 10x the size of your local market. In NYC & Chicago maybe you can open for 6 hours a day and make your rent - but in Vegas that is a 24/7 tourist town where you are in a LOCALS casino.. perhaps you need to adjust for that. \n\nWe were finally seated at 401pm. after some discussion between the staff of who to give us to.. You'd think they'd never viewed a 6'8\" tall person and a 5'8\" fat person before. \n\nFinally we were seated and our very peppy (and nice) waitress told us they were new & they served family style like a tapas bar. that confused me. family style is usually giant bowls/platters of food shared among all parties & tapas is small plates of food which your order many to share or not. oh and 3 times with the \"we're new and just opened\" - kewl. No problem with that. we know - we've seen the hype. \n\nDrinks: \ncocktails: we ordered Bloody mary's. pretty standard for any stocked bar. Nope. not one. not even any tomato juice to fake one. reason? \"We're new\" - so we ordered one of their shots of mescal & a glass of sangria. the shot was fine - the sangria was a mix of odd flavors none of which were to be associated with any sangria i've ever experienced in the 40 years I've been imbibing. & that would be ok if it was drinkable. \nso I McGuyvered my own. I ordered a shot of vodka and an empty glass, 2 orders of their roja salsa - grabbed the lime from the sangria and wallah a Bloody mary. \n\nFood: \nCorn on the cob: delicious. \nSalsas: very good especially their salsa verde, nice full flavor with the roasted tomitilloes shining through the right amount of spice. \n2 orders of tacos in lettuce cups (nice option since they don't have 1 flour tortilla in the place) carne - tender meat and nicely spiced. pastor: dry. \nChicken enchiladas: it's been 12 days and actually I don't even remember how they tasted so it must not have made an impression. \n\nService: \nOther than the major discussion at 355-401pm over us - btw - we could hear you, ladies - our service was ok. nothing special. I guess because they were new. LOL \nThe manager came over and looked quizzically at my McGuyvered Bloody mary glass so I explained my situation. I'm pretty sure they overstaffed since they were new. and he took the sangria off my bill. \n\nTotal bill with 2 shots: 90.00 + 20% tip. \n\nNow for what you've been waiting for and why it's only 2 stars. \nthe hobbit chairs are hella uncomfortable for a person over 6' tall. yes they have bench seating but humpy so not much better. \nno bloody marys is a personal choice. \nHours of operation\nthe stage whispered discussion when we arrived 5 minutes early (and in my defense their door was open and there were people milling about.. did i know it wasn't open? no i didn't. did i know the milling people were actually staff? no i didn't. sorry we interrupted your party) \nThis is \"mexican\" food as envisioned by Victoria Beckham or maybe even Selma Hayek as touted on their website (which btw has NO hours listed) - and if that is your preference, this is a great place to be seen eating and sipping chic drinks. \nit is not a place for people who are fans of street food straight off the back streets of Mazatlan sans the expended bullets or those who think authentic mex is what you get at Taco bell.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vZ4CIMfeos6K7OyYDIlwrQ"}

The host said hi, and then went back to talking.  After a few more seconds and after the manager looked at me and looked away, the host decided to ask if I'd like a table.  I said yes and that there would be one more joining me, so he took me to a table.  The server took about 6-7 minutes to come and greet me and I ordered my drink.  My friend came a few minutes later and I still hadn't gotten my root beer I ordered.  After a few more minutes, the server came back and asked for her drink order and she ordered a pepsi.  I still didn't have my root beer.  After about 10 minutes he comes back with both drinks and we order.  Food comes out fine and it tastes like what we expected but the server is no where in sight.

I have heard about this place from one of my Cali friends and was interested in giving it a go when it opened.  Lucky for me, today was the day it opened and I got to walk in and try one of these bad boys out.  I opted for the 'Cookie' version of their cream puff and was delighted with the amount of cream in it.  There's a lot in there.. I mean A LOT. It was oozing all over my hand and onto the napkin, bursting out with creamy deliciousness.  The outer layer of the cream puff was tough and a little too rigid for my liking.  It wasn't anything like a Liliha Bakery cocoa puff where the puff was just fluffy and soft and easy to devour. No, no.. it took a few well adjusted bites to put the puff pastry down at Beard Papa's and just wasn't what I was expecting as far as having a \"puff\"-like exterior. However, I think for what it is, the flavors work very well together and the cream.. well, that's pretty much the best part about it hands down.  I like the fact that they had some beer and wine on tap (esp. Kirin and Sapporo for you Japanese beer lovers) and they also had some boba, to boot.

Combine that with original, cocoa or cookie housing that completes the cream puff.\n\nBUUUUUUUUT, it didn't taste like their original cream puff. I knew their locations in Tokyo and San Francisco, but this one was inconsistent with my long time previous experiences. The cream was way whipp-y and less custard-y. The Beard Papa's signature cream should be custard-rich flavor!\n\nAlso, while I appreciate the vanilla cream not being too sweet, it went a bit too far to the point where it could be called tasteless. However, the sweetness of the hazelnut cream was decent, so hopefully we were just unlucky to catch an inconsistent batch of the day, it was not their new direction. I'll have to reconfirm.\n\nAs with anything on the Strip, FAME (an Asian-oriented food court at the Linq) is open through midnight so we were able to stop by and have a quick bite at 11pm. That's a big plus.\n\nHowever, three cream puffs with two plain ice teas for $25 seems pricy. I don't mind paying $$$$ for a fine dining, but do mind when I know the original price of a cream puff is less than $2 per piece, and the reasonable pricing constitutes a significant part of the brand. Just because it's on the strip doesn't mean you will pay $100 for a GAP t-shirt. Markup by novelty will quickly degrade as the brand becomes more known. As with anything, pricing it right is the key for a sustainable business - plan accordingly.\n\nAll that said, I very much welcome this new location.

The whole setup is pretty ideal, having a fixed price for a custom pizza or salad is a great idea as we all hate getting nickeled and dimed (or dollared) for adding toppings. And for something that gets baked in an actual fired oven, it's pretty darn quick. I had my pizza in under 5 minutes. \n\nThe place is comfortable, clean, fairly priced, and has ample seating, even around lunch time.

Right outside the front door.  Clearly a violation of the AZ smoking laws.  We were on our way out so we held our breath and blew through the smoke.

Gotta say, crunchy and crispy truffle fries is the best in town by far!  My favorite salad is the Caesar; the crunch of the chickpea and romaine heart was lovely, and the shave Parmesan cheese really brought out the flavors and aroma of a spring/summer feel.\n\nDing! Round 2, burger time. My ratings from bottom to top La Bandita, The Classic, Magic Shroom, Thunderbird, Continental Club, and the winner Ahi Tuna.  I said it once and I'll say it again; the best and probably the only Ahi burger in town.  I don't even care for sushi, but this sushi in a bun brought this Yelper to his knees.  The Honey Wasabi is what makes this burger for me; strong sweet pungent kick to the nostrils while the subtle tuna mellows it out.  The Nori chips and sprouts provide a nice texture while the Teriyaki finishes it off with a sweet taste to the palate!\n\nDing! Round 3, dessert round!  Sea salt caramel milkshake is good, but the star of the dessert round is the pretzel and Nutella shake.  Nectar of the gods; or Yelp!  This milkshake deserves a Pulitzer Prize for making my palates scream for more.

I was not the biggest fan of the Ahi burger but I did not hate it either. That one took 2nd place. The Mellow Mushroom and Veggie option were my favorites in the Non Classic categories. I thought their salads were out of this world, and loved the two milkshakes we got to sample; the Salted Carmel and Nutella Pretzel.\n\nThe drink choices here are very unique. We had samples of almost all their specialty drinks. Their version of a Bloody Mary is great. It is called a, \"Hey Neighbor\" and has beet juice in it.

I wasn't sure if I wanted to drive all the way out there to Hopdoddy.  This was my first Elite event and I wasn't sure what to expect.  I'm so glad that I decided to take that long drive out there.  I had a great time.\n\nWhen I first got there I was greeted in my personal opinion the personification of Yelp in the lovely Lindsey D. Seriously, this women is all over Yelp setting up events.  I saw her at the Yelp Downtown Revival back in May, but I never got the chance to meet her.  I finally got to at this event. She was very nice and very approachable and just an all around awesome hostess.  \n\nI couldn't find any place to sit at first, it was seriously packed.  Luckily 2 women offer to let me sit with them.  And I couldn't have found 2 nicer people to sit with for this event.  Nicole B. and Ashley P. were awesome!  All 3 of us click right away as we were discussing which burgers were the best and just talking about anything and everything.  Then we were greeted by fellow Elite Monica O. She came by the table to introduce herself and she was really cool and funny.   Mike was a cool server who had such energy that he really seemed to enjoy what he does.  But when I go there again... I'm looking for Katy to be my server.  If Lindsey is the personification of Yelp.  Then Katy is the personification of Hopdoddy.  She was so informative about everything, always made sure we had what we needed.  And did it all with the biggest smile on her face and again had that energy.\n\nI know I've wrote this much and haven't said one thing about the burgers.  I'm sorry.  As you can see the people are what makes these Yelp events fun to attend.  As for the burgers, they were all very good.  The only one i wasn't a big fan of was the La Bandita.  It just didn't have that burst of flavor the other ones had when you bite into it.  My personal favorite was the Magic Shroom.  Oh my god! What a mighty fine burger that was. And I only had a quarter of it.  I'm afraid if i eat the whole thing what might happen.  The Ahi Tuna was another favorite of mine and i'm not that big of a fan of Tuna prepared that way. The winner was the classic Bacon Cheeseburger.  There is a reason why the classics are the classics.  Magic Shroom should've had it though, I call for a recount.  \n\nThe sides that they offered were also very good.  I like the spinach arugula salad they had.  And the truffle fries were very good.  I didn't take a look at the menu cause I wanted to have something to look forward to when I go there again.  The cool part about all of this besides the food.  Is I met a lot of really cool people for a couple of hours and made some new Yelp friends which is always good.  \n\nThanks to everyone at Hopdoddy and Yelp for putting on a great event.  Can't wait for the next one and hope to see some of my new Yelp friends there.  Now if you excuse me.  I'm going to go floss my teeth and hope that there is some Magic Shroom left stuck in between my teeth.  I know, it's disgusting! Don't judge me!

But these Yelpers need their meat.  I don't think our vegetarian friends RSVP'd to this one.  The Ahi burger may have stolen the show if it weren't for the unexpected wasabi that some of us spice-wimps could not get past.  In the end, the classic burger with cheese and bacon won it all, and for good reason.  The angus beef patty was as tender and flavorful as I remembered from a previous visit, the toppings were a winning combination, and this was a clear crowd favorite.  \n\nIn case that wasn't enough food, we enjoyed some starters of seasonal salads, quinoa, regular fries and truffle fries.  Each salad had its high points but my favorite was the spinach and arugula, with avocado.\n\nTo wash it all down we sampled four of their cocktails and got to visit their fountain of Maine Root colas.  The margarita was pretty standard, and my favorite was the sweet tea.  Their bloody mary using beet juice was unexpectedly good too.\n\nDessert?  Hopdoddy has some creative and delicious shakes of all flavors.  We tried the popular Caramel and Sea Salt shake and the Nutella and Pretzel.  Yumm-my.  \n\nThe icing on the proverbial burger was the service.  Erin was friendly, helpful, and took the time to meet each of us and talk to us for a few minutes.

I ate a burger and a half!!  But it was all for a good cause:  So I could let you know which one was the best!! These were the burgers I tried:\n\nThe Classic:  Nice peppered beef patty with lettuce tomato, yummy cheddar and BACON!  There is a reason things end up being known as 'classics' namely because it is yummy in the traditional sense of yum (My number 2)\n\nThe Magic Mushroom:  I love mushrooms, especially on a burger...unfortunately I am not a fan of goat cheese.  But this was still a delicious burger.  I could easily modify this and bang it out of the park for me! (My number 5)\n\nThe Continental:  was a turkey burger club with fresh pesto.  The thing that sets this turkey burger apart is the juicy turkey patty!! No dry crumbly turkey here! That combined with the flavor of the pesto, the honey wheat bun, arugula and the BACON, you really can't go wrong. (My number 3)\n\nThe Thunderbird:  This burger had a zing with delicious roasted pablano peppers and their yummy BACON!  This one would have been ranked higher if the others were not so darn amazing! (My number 4)\n\nThe Bandita:  I'm not going to lie I'm a voracious carnivore, and I was calling it the dirty bandita.  It was a dry blackbean veggie burger.  In the Bandita's defense I do not ever eat anything vegetarian unless it is salad or a veggie tray and I tend to hate cooked veggies...but yeah I would never eat this.  (My only yuck at number 6)\n\nDrum roll please!  I saved the best for last!\n\nTHE AHI TUNA Burger!  GET IT.  First of all Hopdoddy uses the highest grade ahi tuna and has their own boats that legally catch their fish!  The sauce is teriyaki and wasabi, which is a delicious, sweet, tangy, zingy combo!  The sprouts compliment the flavors of the tender, pink tuna perfectly!  Nori Chips give this burger that extra \"ooooo aaaahhhhh\"  that you weren't expecting!  (NUMBER ONE)\n\nThey had good salads, beverages and fries too, but let's face it- YOU Are Coming Here for a Yummy Burger!!!  Shoot I forgot to mention the amazing milkshakes!

The Baby Kale salad came out swinging, armed with avocado and pomegranate vinaigrette.\n\nAnd then... it was ON! The first casualties were spectator favorites: Both the Classic Burger and Magic Shroom won hearts that day. Even mushroom-averse folks tipped a hat to the power of the Shroom. The next contenders were the Continental (turkey burger), La Bandita (black bean corn patty), Thunderbird Chicken, and Ahi Tuna that tore into taste buds with a fiery honey wasabi. Each burger fought valiantly, but the burger that raised from the ashes like a phoenix, was in fact, the favorite of Phoenix that fateful day - the Classic w/ Bacon and Cheese. Bravo!!\n\nShout-outs to our spectacular waitress Katie whose assistance and enthusiasm was infectious and much appreciated.

The answer is nothing of course! \n\nThis was another amazing Yelp Elite event hosted by the equally amazing Hopdoddy Burger Bar. The event started with the regular check in, signing your name to a Yelp sticker. We then were all greeted by Lindsey are amazing Community Manager who informed us of how the night's burger battle would go down and also gave us an awesome Yelp Elite beach towel!\n\nThe way the battle worked was on a rating scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being the favorite and six being the least favorite. Once we all found our seats they started to bring out the first of the food options which included quinoa, fries, and fresh salad. They also brought around the first of the drink sample which was the frozen margarita. \n\nOnce we had all had a little bit of the appetizers, the burgers begin to come out of the kitchen. The first option to try was the Classic which is the typical all American burger with cheese and fresh toppings. It was followed by five other burger options which included a turkey burger, chicken burger, ahi tuna burger and a vegetarian option made from black beans. Each burger was cut into quarter sample sizes so we didn't fill up so quickly that we couldn't try it all!\n\nThe drinks varied from a limeade option to a Bloody Mary house mix that included both beet and tomato juice. Once everyone had tried all of the burger patties they offered for the battle everyone then filled out their ballot form using the 1-6 ranking. All of the ballots were counted and the ultimate winner was the Classic Burger - I mean how do you beat the original classic burger? The very close runner up was the ahi burger which was an overwhelming fan favorite as well!\n\nOnce the winner was announced, two different shake variety samples were brought out, which included Nutella and pretzels, and a sea salt and caramel option. \n\nEverything I had was amazing, made fresh, and definitely worth a second try on a return visit! This was not my first time at Hopdoddy and it excelled in every way as it always does. It's no surprise that this location has four and a half stars out of 5 with a plethora of reviews under its belt. \n\nThe service was impeccable with a special mention for Katy who was awesome from start to finish, answered all of our questions, and kept us entertained throughout the entire meal!! Tony was also exceptional in his service (I believe he was the store manager) and was extremely attentive to everyone that attended. \n\nI will definitely be returning to Hopdoddy since it's my favorite burger bar in all of Arizona - and this event only solidified it as my fave! Tonight's event couldn't have gone off any better and I couldn't have been more excited to be able to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime event and couldn't be more thankful to Hopdoddy and Yelp for making it possible!!\n\nOverall: A+\nI mean, seriously, it's an event put together by Lindsey, Yelp and an amazing burger bar ... did you expect less than an A+??", "type": "review", "business_id": "suO9O-o1wk9DxYIemojpXQ"}

I'm going to be in a food coma after this... and boy was I... lol\n\nWe started out with some salads. I liked their Caesar salad and their fries. & I love me some good fries!! \n\nSo many burgers, so little time... So we got to try 6 different burgers and voted on which burger we liked the best. The classic burger, the magic shroom, the continental club, the ahi tuna, la bandita, and the thunderbird. My favorite was the continental club. Coming in 2nd place for me was the thunderbird. The Continental Club comes with Turkey, Provolone, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Arugula, Mayo & Basil Pesto on Whole Wheat. It was bomb.com and was a good mixture of everything and I loved the bread that came on it. A lot of my fellow Yelpers liked the Ahi Tuna Burger. This was a good one but the wasabi killed it for me. \n\n\n\nWe also got spoiled with samples of drinks, the margarita, PV Sweet tea, Mikes hard lemonade, bloody mary (the neighbor), Four Peaks sunbrew. I really liked the sweet tea. & you can't forget the shakes! The Nutella shake and the Salted Caramel shakes were amazing!!! Don't ask me which one I liked better. lol. \n\nThe customer service was great! Everyone was so friendly and helpful and they trained their staff extremely well because everyone was very knowledgeable with the menu. \n\nThank you so much for organizing another great event Lindsey and to Hopdoddy for having us!", "type": "review", "business_id": "suO9O-o1wk9DxYIemojpXQ"}

Thank you so much to Lindsey, Yelp, and especially Hopdoddy for hosting us Elite Yelpers! \n\nFirst and foremost, the staff was amazing. A huge thank you to Katy! She was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about Hopdoddy - from the Scottsdale location to the Texas locations. A thank you to Erin, Tony, and Mike as well! It was so nice to see how happy all the staff were and giving off great vibes.\n\nNow, for the food. We started with a variety of salads and fries. I especially loved the Quinoa salad - it was really good! (I didn't see it on their online menu, so hopefully it isn't just a special! I'd order that again in a heartbeat.) As Yelpers snacked on the starters, drinks were being handed out. I was able to try the frozen margarita, the black cherry limeade, a sweet tea, and a Bloody Mary with beet juice. My favorite was the sweet tea drink - house Infused Lemoncello, Deep Eddy Sweet Tea Vodka, Raspberry Pur\u00e9e, & Fresh-Squeezed Lemon. Yum! (The margarita and limeade were pretty good too.) \n\nSoon, the battle began. Burgers were being brought out left and right. They were cut into quarters and then gulped down by hungry Yelpers.  As part of the battle, we were able to try a total of six burgers and then had to rate them from 1-6. \n\nThe Classic: The name says it all. Burger, cheese, bacon, plus the basics (lettuce, tomato, onion). Not surprisingly, this is the burger that won!\n\nThe Thunderbird: Chicken burger, bacon, poblano chilis, plus the basics. This was one of my favorite of the night. Spicy and full of flavor! \n\nThe Continental: Turkey burger, bacon, cheese, plus the basics. I really liked this one as it tasted like a club sandwich. Delicious! \n\nMushroom: Burger, mushrooms, goat cheese, and pesto plus the basics. Oooh. As far as mushroom burgers go, this is one of the best. The goat cheese and pesto make a winning combo.\n\nAhi Tuna: Tuna patty, wasabi, with nori chips and the basics. Not something I would normally eat but I'm glad I was able to try it tonight. It was a new experience! It had a great flavor. \n\nEl Bandito: Black bean burger, avocado, cheese, plus the basics. This was my least favorite. The burger fell apart and just wasn't as flavorful as the others. \n\nOnce the battle was over, it was time for dessert. Out came samples of the sea salt caramel shake and the Nutella/chocolate pretzel shakes. I loved the caramel shake - it was heavenly!  \n\nThe biggest surprise of the night was during the raffle for a gift card and my name was called. Thanks to Yelp and Hopdoddy - I can't want to come back! I definitely know what I'll be ordering next time!\n\nOverall, it was a great time! I was able to meet some friendly Yelpers (shout out to Don C and Ashley P!), taste a lot of goodies, and go home happy/stuffed. Once again Lindsey has outdone herself and hosted a great event. Looking forward to the next!", "type": "review", "business_id": "suO9O-o1wk9DxYIemojpXQ"}

So... many... burgers.... I don't think it was possible to leave this event hungry... light bites indeed. We started with some incredibly delicious salads - the quinoa salad was acidic in all the right ways... I wish I made quinoa taste so good. The caesar was a pure original and the chunks of cheese on it were fantastic. We also had perfectly crispy fries with cheese sauce *drool* And the burgers... oh the burgers.... My fave - the classic burger- had bacon, cheese, and yummy all over it. We also had the magic mushroom burger (really tasty, sort of pesto -y flavor), The chicken burger- which was shockingly moist and tasty, the ahi burger (this was good and I don't like tuna very much), the turkey burger, and the veggie burger. We also had the truffle fries (so good! ) and two different shakes.... ahhh, the shakes. Needless to say, I will be back!

We started off with different types of salads which were all delicious, I really enjoyed the kale salad that included watermelon, I would come back for the salads alone. The truffle fries were also fantastic with garlic & parmesan and a tasty cheese dipping sauce, I had to pace myself on eating too much of these, because I had SIX burgers to try and after the glutton fest at Smashburger I knew to go slow or I would run out of room in my belly. \n\nThis event was different in that it was a contest for the best burger. Everything we tried was very good, my favorite was the Ahi Tuna Burger which I can't believe didn't win! The sushi grade fresh ahi was seared at a perfect temp and the crunch of the sprouts along with a wasabi aioli made for a happy palette. My second favorite was the Continental which was a turkey patty with goat cheese, provolone, bacon and pesto. This combination made for some great flavors too. \n\nTo go with the burgers we were offered tastings of their delicious cocktails. I tried the frozen margarita which was nice and strong, the black cherry hard limeade was a perfect summer cocktail, and as an Arnold Palmer lover the Soco Sweet Tea was right up my ally. \n\nTo top it all off, we were then given samples of the Salted Caramel and Nutella Pretzel shakes. Both were equally delicious and indulgent. This was yet another event where I left full and happy and enjoyed the delicious food, drinks, desserts and company.

I have to say I was leery of the Spinach & Arugula, because it had beets in it (WTH WHO DOES THAT) but I have to say it was amazing, it had beets, goat cheese, toasted pecans, sugar snap peas, gala apple & sherry cane vinaigrette with the spinach and arugula mixed perfectly, the flavors of everything went so well together. I was very surprised I liked the salad with beets the most. The 2nd runner up in great tasting salads for me was the Harvest Quinoa, just a great spicy flavor.\n\nWe also have some Adult drinks to try, Margaritas, Black Cherry hard lemonade and a bloody marry with beet juice, everything was great and went well with the burgers, the only one I would say no too is the Bloody Mary, it just was a little Bloody Mary for me (not a drink I normally have)\n\nNow it's time for the real taste testing to happen. The contenders:\n\n1) The Classic : angus beef medium rare, cheddar cheese topped with crispy bacon, tomatoes and lettuce\n\n2) The Magic Shroom :  angus beef medium rare, goat cheese, field mushrooms, mayo & basil pesto\n\n3) Continental Club: turkey, provolone, apple smoked bacon, arugula, mayo & basil pesto on whole wheat bun\n\n4) La Bandita: black bean-corn patty, avocado, goat cheese, arugula cilantro pesto, chipotle mayo on whole wheat bun\n\n5) The Thunderbird: chicken, roasted poblano chili, cheese, bacon, avocado\n\n6) Ahi Tuna Burger: sushi grade tuna, sunflower sprouts (we asked what type) teriyaki, honey wasabi (now don't go thinking its sweet, this has POW behind it!) nori chips, pickled ginger and mayo\n\nFor me the winner was the Ahi Tuna Burger, but the winning burger for the evening was The Classic! \n\nHopdoddy finished the night with some tasty milkshakes; I tried the Caramel & Sea Salt & Nutella & Chocolate Pretzel. Soo dang good!\n\nOur server was Katie, and she was amazing, full of great information and jokes, gotta love that!\n\nI truly enjoyed this event, had a great time and even met a few new to me Elites, Hiya Don C, Nicole B (loved that dress, meant to tell you) Ashley!! I even walked away a winner of a gift card!

And despite the fact that I already decided (before the event) that this is my favorite burger joint, I would have never tried the plethora of other phantasmagorical burgers and salads on offer here at HD.  So, thanks to Lindsey and the generous staff at Hopdoddy, I now have new favorites ranging from the Magic Mushroom burger to the Baby Kale Salad.  And there is still nowhere else in all the valley that I would send someone for a burger.\n\nAnd the best way to go down my very detailed list is to go in order of the magically delicious, well seasoned, and locavore salads that I sampled this night.\n\n1.\n Harvest Quinoa Salad - Spectacular flavors and textures for a simple buttery grain mixed with local crunchy produce such as carrots and onions\n2.\nSpinach and Arugula Salad - Delectable yellow and red beets, texas goat cheese, roasted pecans, sherry cane vinaigrette, avocado and sugar snap peas all came together to make this an incredible explosion of healthy flavors\n3.\nHail Caesar Salad -  BEST I HAVE EVER HAD and highly recommend.  Also wonderful textures with crisp hearts of romaine, baby romaine leaves, a flavorful house made anchovy dressing, carrots, potato hay, shaved parmesan, spicy fried chickpeas, and radicchio for extra crunch\n4.\nGreen Chile Queso - pour it on a burger, dip your truffle fries in it, its perfect as far as queso goes\n5. \nThe signature truffle fries with parmesan, served with a truffle aoli.  Hands down best fries in town, second only to Ramsay Burger in Vegas.\n\nSo, what to wash it all down with....\nWell, aside from their selection of Main Root Brand sodas and lemonades, made with 100% cane sugar and with no added flavors, colors, or that yucky high fructose corn syrup - the servers were busy passing around everything on their cocktail menu from the Soco Sweet Tea to the Bloody Mary.  Hopdoddy uses the same in preparing these, including the use of fresh squeezed juices and syrups made in house with fresh ingredients.  The Bloody Mary, made with beets, is an absolutely must try!\n\nFor non-alcoholics, the Main Root Prickly Pear Lemonade was outstanding, as well as the Blueberry Soda and Doppelganger (their version of the root beer)\n\nAnd without further ado, the reason we were gathered here in the first place, the Burger Battle:\n\nIn order of tastiest to almost as tasty...\n\n1.  Magic mushroom - Texas goat cheese, well seasoned and sauteed field mushrooms, an incredibly juicy beef burger, and a Mayo and Basil Pesto for an extra flavor explosion\n\n2. The Classic Burger - Juicy angus beef, bacon, onion, lettuce, tomato, and their signature sassy sauce (again, it is the juicy and flavorful beef patty that wins this classic)\n\n3.  La Bandita - A veggie burger with a dozen ingredients and so packed with flavor!  A black bean, beet and corn patty, zuccini, carrots, quinoa, roasted pumpkin seeds, avocado, arugula, goat cheese, and a chipotle and cilantro pesto mayo for extra kick.\n\n4.  The Thunderbird - A chicken burger with pepper jack cheese, apple smoked bacon, arugula, spicy seared poblanos, pico de gallo, and a mayo basil pesto.  Wow!\n\n5. The Continental Club - Turkey burger ground with a basil pesto and sundried tomato mix, topped with provolone, arugula, apple wood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato and slathered in a Mayo and Basil Pesto.  (Never thought I would love a turkey burger this much)\n\n6. The Ahi Tuna Burger - the one item I did not sample but heard rave reviews, and was astounded by the generous size of the Sushi-grade Tuna Steak .\n\nTo round out the event, feeling quite gluttonous, we were happily surprised to be able to sample their toothsome shakes as well.\n\nThe Caramel and Sea Salt, as well as the Nutella and Chocolate Pretzel were as divine as everything else we had sampled that evening - and our table ordered the Chocolate Stout shake as well, our favorite one of the three and a fantastic way to end the evening.\n\nIt was a spectacular event - both for its intimacy and the ability to further sample the menu of one of my favorite restaurants.  As always, there was cool schwag like the Yelp beach towel, and some lucky Elites received $50 gift cards to HD.\n\nThank you thank you burger gods, and Hopdoddy, and Lindsey for creating another memorable Yelp event.", "type": "review", "business_id": "suO9O-o1wk9DxYIemojpXQ"}

My body has finally emerged from a serious food coma allowing me to type.

Although the invitation said \"Burger Battle\" it did not say \"eat until you die because you want to\". \n\n(Really the invitation should have provided a warning. Something like: Wear yoga clothing that stretches. The Buddha belly may cause discomfort.)\n\nGreeted with a Yelp Elite towel (squee!) I meandered over to the soda bar. Mixing and matching my soda was fun and deeelicious. My pre-game before Burger Time was my downfall. Yes to picking up fries. Yes to the salads. (Hey, that's healthy stuff!) Yes to the margarita. (And all later beverages.) I figured I'd nibble and be ok.\n\nNo. Definitely not.\nI very much enjoyed the kale salad (with watermelon!) And I wouldn't give up sampling cheese on my fries for anything. However, by the time we were on our third burger I was in trouble. (The second round of fries, sprinkled with parmesan and truffle oil did not help either :)\n\nIt's all a blur now. The burgers were smashingly delicious. But when I bit into the Ahi Tuna burger the earth tilted. If I hadn't been ready to explode I would have begged for another sample. I waddled out of Hopdoddy dreaming about how soon I could eat another. \n\nI went back the very next day for a tuna burger. (Yeah, it's that good.)\n\nThis was an amazing event.

I'd like to see more diverse wines by the glass, including another Zinfandel selection. \n\nThe menu was that of a typical steakhouse with a variety of different cuts and sizes. I got the filet which was perfectly cooked. Beware - if you order a sauce they do not serve it on the side, they put it right on the steak. You can also get your steak cooked with a special rub seasoning too. \n\nOrdered some sides, including the wild rice, which was very wild! If you like unusual wild rice - go for it!\n\nAll in all, I see great potential with Rare Steakhouse.

Or, underwhelming. You get the idea. I so wanted it to be amazing, but it just wasn't and it could be and should be.\n\nI've gone for 3 stars as I feel it's a compromise between what Serrano Manchego has got right, and what it's got wrong. The d\u00e9cor alone warrants a solid 4, verging on to 5. The service and the food are definitely a 2 (\"meh, I've experienced better\", I couldn't have said it better myself!).\n\nI'm going to start with the good. The place looks fantastic. It's all exposed brick and wood with the logo stencilled on the wall. Lovely. Lots of space and tables. A definite thumbs up on this. And I love the concept, a Spanish pincho bar on Leith Walk. Only one beer on draught (Alhambra), bite sized snacks and platters, signature croquettas, great! And erm. That's the good. The d\u00e9cor and the concept.\n\nThe bad? Well I'll start with the service. I'm probably not being fair, as yesterday was their opening night (although as stated on their Facebook page this wasn't a soft opening, it wasn't an exclusive party, it was just open), but given the amount of time they've spent into decorating and sourcing ingredients, they really ought to have trained their staff! I'd be surprised if any of the bar staff/servers has worked in a bar or a restaurant before. Not one of them knew how to pour a pint, so the manager had to teach them on the job, and of course this meant that it took ages to get served (and what's with ringing up a transaction on the sole till before pouring the drinks?). And if you'd ordered food you got a numbered wooden spoon in a glass, fairly standard. But the poor girls serving spent most of the evening wandering about in a daze looking for whoever had ordered that particular dish... The staff were all perfectly nice, they were just all woefully inexperienced. I ought to point out that I was with my boyfriend and sister, both experienced bar staff and servers, so as you can imagine we had little tolerance, but even if I'd been there alone I'd still have been frustrated.\n\nAnd the food, oh the food. A great concept doesn't make up for poor execution. There's a nice sounding selection of cold and hot pinchos, as well as tostados, platters and the croquettas of the day. I don't know if this will always be the case, but they only had one croquette on yesterday, which was haggis. Or was it? I was definitely told it was haggis, but biting into it you'd never have known. Sure, the herbs and spices tasted a little like our national dish, but the texture was creamy and the colour was pale and the taste was bland. What was it?! We also ordered a dish of olives. What we got was a small plate (not a bowl, which would have made more sense), of pitted olives that looked and tasted like they'd come straight from a jar. I don't buy jarred olives at the supermarket, I don't expect to be served them in a bar. And pitted, who serves pitted olives?!\n\nI'd like to say everyone else's food look great, but judging by the table next to us that isn't the case. They'd ordered a platter of manchego, blue cheese, walnuts, quince and raisins that came with no blue cheese. There was an explanation for this, but I didn't catch it, and given they'd only been open for 3 hours at this point I sincerely hope they hadn't run out. Then came the tostados, or bread with a topping. Standard, I know, and I wasn't expecting anything brilliant from a basic open sandwich, but they just looked so uninspiring. Fortunately none of the food is expensive.\n\nI actually feel annoyed about it all. I wanted Serrano Manchego to be brilliant. They've had a great Facebook presence and I know I wasn't the only local eagerly awaiting its opening, and it was packed last night. I want to give them a second chance, because I truly believe that they could be great if only they improve. Please guys, the problems I've identified should be easy to fix! I really hope that in a couple of months time I'll be writing an updated review of 4 or 5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xT1MO7MLMp3jK4XT1LXiKA"}

Everyone inside was taking up a lot of room, so that a trip to the bar or bathroom was an obstscle course of sorrys and excuse me's....\n\nThe other main problem was the tiny wee space at the bar for ordering, most of the bar being used for seating, and occupied, so queueing ensued and despite the army of staff behind the small bar, they simply didn't have room to get your order till the person in front was done....\n\nThrow into the mix that there is NO table service, for approx 8 outside tables and maybe 15 squeezed in inside, and i can predict a war on busier days at that teeny weeny service area.. Staff still came from behind the bar to clear empty plates and glasses and refused to take orders and failed to notice who were no doubt ex Dalmany Bar gents getting in thru the (probably illegally) open fire exit and plonking themselves down.\n \nLeith has been teased by their opening for over a year now, and yet i found a toilet with a broken lock and the other with a really broken seat, no toilet paper and very very very dirty floors.

We walked over and grabbed a couple slices of pepperoni and a sample of the daily special. \n\nIt was ok. I've eaten far worse by way of pizza...but this was not a great-I-want-to-have-them-again pizza experience either.  I will likely give them another chance - a few months down the road- and see if the issues we experienced were just opening issues.\n\nThe slices are served piping hot from the oven and huge! This should be a good thing, yet when we picked up our slices (to fold and eat...ya know like ya do) the crust broke. It wasn't completely done.  Burning hot greasy cheese and pepperoni oozed its way through the cracks make it difficult to eat.  I love greasy pizzas, don't get me wrong, but I don't like wearing them because the crust can't stand up. \n\nLest you think I'm just being a picky crust person, my husband also had issues with his slices. Similarly the owner and chef both voiced (in a conversation between them, but not to the customers but carried out in front of us) that the oven wasn't heated properly and nothing was coming out done correctly.  Did they offer to throw our slices back in? Nope. Nothing was even said to us. \n\nIt's a new restaurant, it's possible to fix these issues. We'll see. I'll adjust my review later. \n\nAlso...as a side note....not having anything to do with my rating but wanting people to be aware. This is a very tiny place. At most 5 people can sit.

Be warned: they take both the food and the atmosphere very seriously (in a good way).\n\nWe happened to stop by for opening night this evening and were really impressed with the space and the service. The restaurant is in one of the old buildings on the 100 block of state street and they kept a lot of the original features when they built the current business (the stained glass windows, plaster trusses, and hardwood floors are original features).\n\nOne thing I was really impressed by was the waiter's knowledge of the menu and pronunciation of Italian dishes. He really helped us order the right items based on what we were hungry for.\n\nI got the mushroom gnocchi, which was out of this world. We also got the arancini as an appetizer and I got to try some of my friend's margherita pizza. The food is the real highlight of this place, as everything was delicious.\n\nThe prices were high-end for Madison; our bill came out to about $45 per person with a round of drinks, an appetizer, and entrees.\n\nI felt a little under dressed as most of the staff were wearing fancier clothes and the managers were donned in suits. I would say the dress code is dressy casual.\n\nCaitlin, resident sommelier of Fresco, stopped by to answer some of our questions about the building and tell us about their opening. She was quite knowledgeable and very friendly, offering her opinion of our dinner options.\n\nI absolutely loved the place and will be taking friends and family back presto.", "type": "review", "business_id": "phhIK_ibq30MYfPe1RqnuQ"}

I can tell that Food Fight and chef Michael Pruett were meticulous when choosing the location and designing the space and menu for this new Italian restaurant.\n\nI will say that it has to be one of the most aesthetically pleasing spaces i've seen in a restaurant. Everything inside it looks brand spanking new, or it's super old to the point where it's charming. There's really too many facets about it to list, and the people there can describe it better than I can, so i'd recommend checking the space out for yourself to witness it. It's just gorgeous.\n\nAll of the food that I tasted that night was spot on. Among them included the Arancini (which are fried Risotto balls), which was a goodie because it managed to satisfy my impulse for fried things without tasting greasy at all. The ricotta-filled agnolotti was also good, although more mild/subtle on its flavors. The fennel was an excellent side dish to go along with the agnolotti. Finally, for dessert we all split a slice of what was dubbed an olive oil cake, and that was delectable. Also, note that the cocktails are well worth a go, particularly the Mulo Romano. That was a very flavorful drink, and i'm excited to have another one of those soon.\n\nMuch like the setting, the service we received on opening night was also stellar. Our server Alex had an extensive knowledge of the menu, which was useful for us, as the menu isn't the easiest to read through for people not used to it. Everyone was accommodating, polite, and the orders all came out timely. I couldn't really ask for anything better.\n\nThe only thing Cento disappointed me on was the portion sizes, which I felt were a bit small. This could just be because I was famished entering the place that day, and i'm a man with a gigantic appetite. So, others maybe won't find this to be a problem. Besides that, I felt like Cento nailed all of the aspects of a dining experience, which is no easy task!", "type": "review", "business_id": "phhIK_ibq30MYfPe1RqnuQ"}

Before our 7-course meal started, we were treated to 3 amuse-bouches, making it more like a 10-course meal.  The table was in the back, right next to where the chefs prepared everyone's meals.  The ambience was very classy and comfortable.  The staff was very polite and our water glasses never got below half-full.  Chef Michael personally delivered each course and gave a nice explanation of each thing we were enjoying.\n\nWithout question, the highlight was the food.  The chef's table cost was $75 per person, but we probably enjoyed about $140-worth of food per person.  The sausage-filled, bacon-wrapped dates were the best appetizers we've ever eaten.  The prosciutto-wrapped branzino was the best fish dish we've ever eaten as well.  Both raw meat dishes (the hamachi crudo and beef tartare) had such fresh meat and were so well-seasoned that it was difficult to tell that the meat was raw.  Each course had a presentation that looked like an art piece.  It was easily the best meal from top to bottom that we've ever eaten.\n\nThe menu includes a variety of appetizers, flat-bread pizzas, pastas, fish, and red meat dishes.  The pizzas are in the $12-$15 range and the majority of the entrees are in the $20-$30 range.  It will be well worth your trip to eat there.

No salt and pepper is provided on any of the tables. The boned half chicken had a nice texture but was similarly under seasoned and required the salt and pepper. The fish items on the menu are all farm raised. The steak tartar came on a huge wafer-esque cracker that oddly tasted fishy. The tartar itself consisted of perhaps 2 tablespoons of bland and chewy beef. The only interesting item we ordered was the beet salad.

The Bistro, although currently a little difficult to find due to lack of real signage, is a cute and trendy little bistro with a great selection of drinks and good options for breakfast and lunch.  If you're familiar with the Deli's signature carrot cake, good news, they offer it here too!  The cashier caught me drooling and immediately knew why, so obviously I'm not the only fan.\n\nMy hubby ordered the special of the day which was frozen berry iced tea and a loaded bagel breakfast sandwich with turkey,egg, cheese, and pesto...both were tasty!  I got the chai latte with vanilla, and though my latte was a little sweet for my taste, they were happy to adjust it to my liking (I tend to like less sugar, no fault of the drink).  I also got the quiche which came with a salad for $5, great deal!\n\nI give this place a 5 because for the location, locally produced food/teas, drink selection, ambiance, and friendly staff, it is a place I will definitely come back to.

We came for the $1 coffee special and because we like local places, but we ended up ordering food and trying out this recently opened place.  \n\nMy wife had the bacon quiche was good but came out cold;  even the second time parts of it were barely warm.  It was a $5 special which was nicely priced for the portion.  I had the biscuits and gravy full order which consisted of two biscuits sliced in half and covered with sausage gravy all served in a large pasta bowl type dish. I enjoyed this dish.  The gravy seemed very real as opposed to out of a packet that I can make at home.  The gravy contained small sliced pieces of sausage which was fine with me but it was not the crumbled ground sausage that you often see.  It felt like a nice homemade dish of biscuits and gravy.  It was $6.\n\nBesides the cold quiche and lack of any sort of \"sorry\" from the staff, my only other real complaint is the ordering process we experienced.  I realize that they had only opened about a week ago, but while we read their menu on a black chalkboard behind their counter and decided on our order at the counter, all four employees basically stood there watching us and waiting.  It just felt odd and uncomfortable with all four watching us. \n\nOverall it was a pleasant experience.  The atmosphere setting inside is nice with lots of windows and a quiet setting.  There is room for improvement but if they are anything like The Deli, then they will improve and it will be a nice spot.\n\nI'd like to give it 3.5 stars because after my first visit I'm somewhere between \"A-OK\" and \"I'm a fan\".

I chose this place because they have a website with their menu online! I'm hoping that they will add pictures to every menu item on their website so that my mom and I can let our stomachs and eyes order for us :). We called in our order and drove about 20 minutes to the restaurant. We showed up the day before their Grand Opening so we missed the restaurant when we drove down the road (they have a nice bright sign now though, so you can't miss it)! We were promptly greeted and our food was brought out right away. \n\nMy mom loves to talk so we enjoyed a fun conversation with everyone. They got us to try the melon juice and halo halo and I'm glad they did. The melon juice is like a shredded melon boba :). They add shaved ice to melon juice with shredded melon at the bottom. Super yummy- especially on a hot day. My mom and I couldn't agree on the halo halo though. I like simple halo halo while my mom loves \"loaded\" halo halo with tons of stuff (like the cup is full of beans and jellies and fruit) and D'Pinoy's halo halo is definitely more simple (maybe about a quarter full). I loved it but I'm sure my mom will ask for more fixings in hers next time. The Philippines might seem like a small country but there are many regional differences. Some people just prefer things a certain way because of the region they grew up in. \n\nWe ordered several things including lumpiang shanghai, fried bangus (milkfish), beef kaldereta, chicken curry, pancit bihon, binagoongan fried rice, and beef bulalo. I loved their pancit but my mom didn't care for the tofu in it so I took it all :). The chicken curry has bones but the chicken is very soft and will fall right off it. The beef in the beef bulalo is super soft and absolutely delicious. The binagoongan rice wasn't what I was expecting (it has mangoes and tomatoes on the side- never seen that before) but it was absolutely delicious. Very unique and very tasty! Everything was very good, very soft, and cooked very well. \n\nUnfortunately, we were missing one thing in our order and didn't notice until we got home (oops)! The place isn't that close to us so my mom called back and told them what happened. They were very apologetic and promised to make it right when we return. And we WILL return!

I have been to several water parks this water park was much needed in Henderson and suits its purpose to beat the heat that Nevada reaches during summer months.  \n\nPro's\n\n- Thank you, thank you, thank you for having warm water not freezing cold so my family can enjoy themselves this being said I hope other water parks read this.\n\n- Employees are not all teenagers its a good mix of adult and teens\n\n- Parents can go down the kiddie slides with their kids as long as you don't exceed weight requirements this being a reasonable requirement for kid size slides.\n\n- Lots of life guards the wave pool alone I saw 8 paying attention and being on look out.\n\n- Managers I saw at least 5 walking around park checking on things look for the red shirts.\n\n- Good food get a whole pizza for just under $20  or choice of food combos such as burger and fries, hot dog and fries, chicken finger's etc... Snacks dipping dots were the best, pretzels, cinnamon sticks etc..\n\n- Drinks you can bring in water they check bags so no other drinks or food. They serve all sorts of beverages including beer be prepared to show id and wait for a manager for any alcohol a plus but a hassle to wait.\n\n- You can bring in your own shade structure within size reason. \n\n- Lots of chairs but get their early to find a shaded spot they have lots of shade areas but they go fast this is ongoing with all water parks that I have been to.\n\n-  Fun colorful atmosphere the props are diverse some are vintage others look like Disney props a nice mixture for adults and kids to enjoy.\n\nCon's\n- Signs need to be added as to how to get to certain slides and lazy river/ wave pool\n\n- Misters so your feet don't get too hot ( I suggest  flip flops when walking around )\n\n- Zooma ride way to long of a wait between riders speed it up.\n\n- Weight limit on pink slide bummer my husband could not ride it but glad to here a new slide is going in that seats more that 2. Loved the blue and yellow double tube slides the line went fast and shaded.\n\n- I saw only one girl dancing looking like she loved her job she was standing in the lazy river where it turns into a waiting pool other staff talked but only if provoked would love to see more interaction from staff.  \n\n- Turn up the music you can barely hear it. Get people in the surfing mood.\n\n- The double tube slides 4 people watching 4 slides when green slide was not operating yet. 1 person getting tubes and assisting customers that they get a raft only area I see that staff could be better do three in water and 2 helping get and pass out tubes could help move line faster. \n\nOverall loved it will be back cant wait for the rest of it to be built.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UH4BReVAqpMVjyVroEJAGA"}

I thought they have the whole last year and this year to complete the park. Oh well.\n\nSince the park is still missing 3 main attractions, they decided to lower the price by $6 for adult. \n\nAnyway, we went on a Thursday, a week after it opened. Parking was $5. I was expecting huge crowd like at Wet n Wild, but to my surprise it was no where as crowded as I had thought. Almost all the slides were a walk-on during the early morning into mid-afternoon hours. I overheard one of the lifeguards told the another guest that this was one of the slowest day since it opened a week ago. It may be due to the fact that it was cloudy and looked like it was going to rain.\n\nThe longest we waited for a slide was on Zuma ZOOMa. I would have to say this ride is the only extreme water slide in the park. It has a trap door underneath you, that will drop you in 5 seconds once you step in and they close the glass door. It was very thrilling. \n\nHere's a point of view video I shot of this Zuma ZOOMA trap door body slide:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMDqgckVUoo\n\nFood is a bit pricey since it's an amusement park. What do you expect? they need to make money somehow since most of the guests are season pass holder, they pay once and get to come back as often as they want. So in order to stay in business, they need to boost up their prices on food.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this park! It's so vivid and colorful. I can't wait to come back next summer when everything is completed and they have planted more trees and shrubs.  \n\nI don't know why, but I love Cowabunga Bay more than Wet N Wild Las Vegas. \n\nBy the way, here's a video showing a FULL Complete Tour of Cowabunga Bay Las Vegas for those who wants to see how it looks like before going\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmOs8Sc5tm0", "type": "review", "business_id": "UH4BReVAqpMVjyVroEJAGA"}

I think the park is great and very excited to have it so close.  I realize the park is not finished but just have some minor complaints. \n1st- the pebbles that are used for landscaping really hurt when you step on them, maybe you could put a lil fence around so people walk on the pathway instead of through the landscaping.\n2nd- There needs to be more shade while waiting to ride the tube slides at the bottom.  The shade only seems to work when the sun is directly above, other than that you are frying in the sun. \n3rd- Be carful for the concrete around the top of the lazy river it is very rough and roughed my husbands arm up a bit, nothing bad.\n4th- Please sell the Dole whip in a smaller size, not just large.

I so very much wanted to enjoy this place. It's always an amazing day when you find that a fairly pretentious coffee house is being replaced with something a lot less so! The restaurant is literally across the road from my work and would be an excellent Friday treat for myself and the rest of the office.\n\nThe decor is typical of a lot of places these days - exposed brickwork, unpainted woodwork, hodge-podge furniture etc. And the staff were very accommodating and friendly. All very much a positive, imo.\n\nThere were 4 of us in our party and the 3 guys all opted for the cheese burger, and 2 of them had fries on the side, and I being veggie, had the 1 option on the menu - the Magic Mushroom Burger. All burgers cost the same amount: \u00a37.50 and this is where things get a bit....erm...meh....\n\nThe food arrived around 30 minutes after we sat down. We were all presented with greaseproof paper mats, on top of which came our paper-wrapped burgers. Call me old fashioned, but I like plates or boards to eat off of! This is essentially fast food at gourmet prices. My \u00a37.50 got me a brioche bun with a mildly spicy bean patty, a mushroom, a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, a bit of salad and a mildly spicy salsa. It's important to note that all sides are separate. I remember looking enviously at the gherkins which the guys seemed to have and thinking that just a bit of 'pep' might have changed my entire experience. There's a common misconception that veggie sometimes means bland. Maybe the introduction of some spicy condiments might help out here. I felt a little short-changed, if I'm honest. The Southern, for example, offers a multiple choice of veggie options and comes with a side of fries and a side of slaw for around 50p more. \n\nI really don't want this to be a damning review, after all the 3 guys who I was with absolutely loved their meals, but I just came away feeling that the vegetarian option was simply tacked on to appease folk like me. I will go back as my better half wants to check it out, but I think the next time I really want a burger, I will go to the Southern or Wanaburger and get a hell of a lot more bang for my buck, both in terms of value and actual sustenance.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EYpqqsJZ3L2EFAPK-NEOFA"}

Looking at his facebook it appears that he will be opening in another location.  Price wise it's about the same as other wing locations in town.  I got the lemon pepper and honey bbq.  Usually lemon pepper is my favorite and my go to but in this case I really liked the honey bbq and would order it again.  \n\nThey offer 15 flavors of wings but the new owner said there would be more.  So that is a major difference between Wing King and this new spot.  The Wing King menu had 60 flavors and offered dessert.  They don't currently offer dessert so the yelp check in won't be honored.  I have to take away one star because they could be more generous with the ranch and the blue cheese.

Wing King. *Record scratch. Huh? This aint Wing King!\n\nApparently, its a whole new owner and he named it 702 Wing Spot. Now being the open minded Yelper that I am I was more than willing to give these guys a spin.\n\nWhat I got was the Rat Pack ($9.99). You get one sauce for 10 pieces of wings, fries, and a drink. I wanted to play it safe so I got just honey barbeque.\n\nWhen they brought out my order, it was only 9 wings and they noticed it as soon as they put it down in front of me. They said to just go ahead and start eating and they will bring out the other piece. At first I was thinking that this was a bad first impression. But about 5 minutes later they brought out 3 pieces because they felt bad about their mistake. I was impressed. \n\nAs for the wings, not bad. Not bad at all. I think I will go for more bolder sauces next time like Mango Habanero. The fries were sprinkled with some type of cajun spices which made it pretty good. Not as good as sweet chili glazed fries but good nonetheless. Lastly, you get a 12 ounce can of soda. Not a bad deal for 10 bucks.\n\nAs a bonus, when you check in you get a free dessert! At that time, not all the desserts were available because he just opened so I ended up going with the cheesecake on a stick which normally sells for $3.99. If you refer to my pic, it is a nice sized goodie for you guys with a sweet tooth! It had a rich taste to it just like how a good cheesecake should be.\n\nOriginally I was gonna give them 4 stars but the service more than made up for that supposedly bad first impression. I like these guys. A bit different than Wing King but I am more than happy to recommend these them. For those that are not familiar with this place, they are located in a strip mall kind of setting with other food joints of different ethnicity.

The balsamic vinaigrette was not over bearing on the salad. The grain bowl had a nice spice to it. The menu has prices and also indicates that veggies are undercooked to be nice and crunchy texture.

I went back to the table so my food wouldn't get cold. Another 10 minutes later and still no CC, I asked a server walking by and he said he would check. He didn't come back. A few minutes later another server walked by and he said he would check. About 5 minutes later a manager came to our table to explain that they were out of CC so they had to make more, and that it would be out in a few minutes, she gave us a Cucumber Mint Water for the wait. Neither of us liked it very much. We waited an entire hour from ordering for her CC to finally show up. My girlfriend liked the CC. Overall, the concept of this place is awesome, we need more healthy choices throughout the valley, and the food is pretty good.

There are vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free items on the menu, something for everyone.  I met Shirley B. here for a late lunch and we both had sandwiches, turkey for me and the vegetarian for her, plus she had their beet salad.

Consisting of turkey, applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, tomato, lettuce and mayo on a toasted cranberry walnut bread, PC's turkey sandwich is an especially hearty and tasty version of an item that tends to be boring at most places. \n\nLocated in the same shopping plaza as Gold's Gym, I'm sure the fitness fanatics are happy that PC is here, too.  It's also right next door to Gimme Some Sugar, so if you want to be fit first, then a little fat later, you can kill two birds with one stone.  \n\nOpen from 8:00am-8:00pm daily.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OEUIE8VBa1BbBfr5EPcTOA"}

There's no doubt Im really diggin' this new cafe.  If you worked up an appetite at the gym nearby, they have great healthy options for you here!

What appealed to me was the superfoods like Kale, Beets, and Quinoa in the salads and the artisinal breads and cheeses used for the sandwiches.  All healthy, fresh ingredients, and mega delish!\n \nMy orders so far have been salads, their vegetarian sandwich and custom made juice. The prices are inexpensive, my meals so far have averaged $11. That's pretty good for a place that specializes in healthier choices. You know my gripe about healthy smoothies and juices that cost as much as my lunch. (ahem PH) Well here it's much more reasonable.  So you healthy smoothie fanatics might want to try it for sure.\n \nNice variety of salads in their cold case display that you can choose from. Sold by the scoop starting at $2.75 depending on which salad you get. You can add side of protien to it also.  Scoop equals about a small bowl portion and it didn't leave me starving. The first time I was there I got two different salads and couldn't finish it.  \n\n== Mint Vinaigrette== what a novel idea for the the Kale, Quinoa, Cranberries, Cashews, Feta salad! Dressing light and compliments with the Kale. \n\nAnd Beets, and I detect Oranges? Something citrusy. Ingredients are the perfect engery/refuel booster before or after your workout at the gym.\n\nThe Tandoori Chicken with mango and coconut and Cauliflower Kale with raisins are the more exotic creations spiced with curry...and you know I love yellow curry.\n\nMeatless Monday I got the Vegetarian Sandwich. So good even non vegetarians like me love it. This one was roasted eggplant, roasted red peppers, GOAT CHEESE, olive tapanade on a 9 grain bread. Just BRILLIANT!\n\nThe cafe is pretty chill. Dining area cafe style with just a few tables and high-tops and a picnic bench outdoors if you dare to eat out there in this heat.  \n\nService dining in has been cool so far. Order and pay first at counter. They'll bring food out to your table. Our orders came out in a timely manner. I didn't order anything that needed to be grilled or cooked though. The staff has been really nice and friendly. They already recognize their regular customers . \n\nThey need to hurry up and get that ice tea or brewed tea in. Im not a fan of carbonated sodas and a cheaper alternative to juices and smoothies would be nice. A paper take out menu would be handy too. I was told to look it up online but not everyone is capable of looking it up. Those are some small kinks they need to work on based on my visits. \n\nThey are just four days into their soft opening phase.

I try to eat well but my choices are pretty limited when I am out showing houses. Fast food tends to make me crash in the late afternoon so I try to avoid that. When I heard that Presto Caf\u00e9 was going to open up down in Henderson, I was very anticipative.  I was not disappointed.  I walked in just after lunch time to see the place still pretty full.  The decor was nice and it felt very clean inside.  I also noticed that they had free Wi-Fi which is fantastic for those of us on the go.\nI am a devout carnivore but I decided that I would put Presto Caf\u00e9 to the test, so I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich with the Tropical Wake Up Smoothie.  I took a seat and waited for my order.  It was obvious that people REALLY enjoy eating there.  I noticed the owner, Reza Arshandi, talking with everyone and making them feel at home.  It was great to see everyone enjoying their meal.  You can tell that Reza takes great pride in the food he serves his customers.\nWhen my food arrived, I was very pleased by the presentation.  The sandwich came with a wonderful strawberry and apple salad on the side.  When I took my first sip of my smoothie it was obvious that it was not made from one of those sugary mixes.  I could taste the fruit and it was not heavy at all.  I was also very happy with the sandwich.  Even though the sandwich had eggplant, tomatoes and oil, the bread never got soggy.  It was a great blend of flavors and was very satisfying.  After I was finished I felt full but still energetic which was great because I had a busy afternoon ahead.\nIt's great to find the perfect combination of high quality food, generous servings and good prices.  I was in and out in less time than a normal restaurant but this is not fast food.  It is a great place to go if you want to sit down and relax and still be done in 30 min or so.

When I heard they open another one on the opposite side of town in Henderson. Hell yay! Can never have enough of good thing in life. Best part is both locations is located off 215 so got north and south side of town check and double check. I was going with my favorite either the turkey or reuben sandwich. I figure new location mark try something never had before. I went with the Meatball Sandwiches. Three Meatball sliders. Anyone would be crazy not too get scoop of one of the Presto salads. My go to is always the israeli couscous salad. I love the combination of the mushrooms, perfect couscous, and some truffle oil tossed in with some herbs. I could order three scoops and be in couscous heaven with nice bowl. The Meatball sliders too be honestly VERY surprised the way it turned out. Comes too my sandwich at Presto have my fav and meatball sandwich meatballs nothing gets me personally excited. I ended up having was three amazing sliders! The brioche mini buns (always wrote that sandwich starts with the bread filling second) awesome. It had the nice crust on the outside, moist on the inside, and any slider combination would be the bomb with those buns. The meatball is very tasty. It nice nice depth of flavor and seasonings. Combine just right about of pomodoro sauce (pet peeves overkill on tomato sauce in meatball is recipe for disaster), the cheese, and right about of bread. Some of the best sliders I have had in sometime. I never been too the more upscale meatball restaurant. You pay price of one meatball that can get three meatball sliders. I can tell you would take some Presto Cafe Meatballs hand down over the pricey name brand. I love small business owners and seeing Presto grow from one too two restaurant. Awesome. \n\nThe food totally felt like it was the same quality getting at the other location. They are some differences besides the obvious location. The display for the salads are little different. I prefer the other location only because you have more choices and  looks more appealing nicely lined up side by side. This location not as much in bigger containers, two different levels, and different vibe. Thankfully the quality is still as good as it gets. The new location hold more people in the restaurant. The interior design much more of open kitchen look and seems brighter with the paint color scheme. They do have wi-fi. I not sure if the other location has since I never used it at Presto. \n\nThe customer service was awesome. We lucked out Suzy H and I after training day no one in the place just us.

If you read any of my other reviews I think you'll know I am pretty fair.  Funny thing is, I was actually heading to Frijoles to give them another chance when I saw this place open, and since I love kebabs/kebobs, I couldn't resist.\n\nI like the mediterranean salad, but I would love it if it were a little more simple.  I'd go a little easier on the peppers and the onions and are all of the herbs really necessary?  Plus they were a little heavy handed with them.  Again, simplify it, maybe a little more acid and you've got a hit.  \n\nWill definitely be back and I think these guys have the makings to be successful.

This makes three times I have seen a pizza spot in this location. I stopped in and ordered a \"Monday's Special\" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.\n\nMost pizza joints have a \"slice special\" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special. Aside from pizza they also have wings, fingers, salads, strombolis, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. They also cater.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uUsfpN81JCMKyH6c0D0bTg"}

I wasn't crazy about the pizza joint that was previously here and I typically don't like super thin crust type pizza. my wife told me they have a special on Mondays where you can get a large cheese pizza for around $10 so we ordered one. Inside was busy with customers and there were plenty of staff on hand to get everybody taken care of. The only downside is that they only have about 5 tables inside and since they were filled with customers eating side it left us customers waiting for take out orders huddled together which was awkward. The inside is narrow so there isn't much space when it's busy. \n\nI ended up liking the pizza. It was thin, not too greasy, and had the right amount of cheese and sauce. I can't say I'd pay the regular $12.99 cost for it however with a coupon or a promotion like we got this time it's a good deal. I came back a couple days later for lunch and picked up a couple slices of cheese and a drink for around $6 including tax. The pizza was hot and just as good as a couple days before. The only thing I don't get is why it doesn't come in a take out box? The 2 slices were on a thin paper plate inside a brown paper bag. I wasn't just getting lunch for myself but my wife too and trying to carry it all out plus 2 sodas was effing ridiculous. I like the specials they have and look forward to trying some of the other menu items however if it doesn't come in a proper take out box it might make me not want to come back as often since I wont want to risk dropping all the food trying to carry it to the car.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uUsfpN81JCMKyH6c0D0bTg"}

I was transported right back to NY and the original movie theaters of my childhood. Well, all except the fact this one has a bar, a cool lounge, and some great art hanging on the walls. lol. I had never been here before so was very happy to score an invite. My \"Plus One friend\" loves it here so she was raring to go. I adore the Roosevelt Row area so much so we added this to the really cool things to do in Downtown. Bonus points for eating at Trumpets Ale before the gig. Two new places in one night on Roosevelt Row spells awesomeness. \n\nWe tried all day to guess which \"surprise, locally filmed movie\" they were going to show. I kept guessing \"Raising Az\" because it is the SunDevil in me. CG hates that one. We sparred all day. I crossed my fingers she wouldn't just walk out if they played that one. All her picks were awesome too! We hope to see any of them in the next few months as Yelp picks. Surprisingly, it was really exciting to go to a theater when you had no idea what movie was going to be shown until the credits started flowing. ( I see this as a new home movie party trend)  Az has a long history of movie magic and we had over 200 films to chose from. We were all on the edge of our seats. When the first words to pop up were \"A Lorne Michaels Film\" We heard a loud, \"WOOP!\" from some fellow Rowdy Yelpers.  I still did not know which SNL film it was until the title popped up. I was pretty surprised. I thought I knew most of the films on the local list but forgot about Wayne's World. Lol-- how funny. I relived some of my eighties college music days and definitely those hair band experiences growing up on Long Island listening to Metal/Rock groups like; Zebra, Alice Cooper, and Poison. (Just to name a few)  \n\nWe had a great time tonight. We can not wait to go back. Coincidentally, I had just watched \"World's End\" last night. FilmBar is having a \"Shaun of the Dead\" party on the 25th. I think I heard something about a Zombie Pinata, and that dressing up party Shenanigans were predicted to ensue. Yes, please.
